That‚Äôs the first thing you do starting a game. Unfortunately it‚Äôs supposed to appear in your inventory. It just disappears in my game. So I deleted Dust from my iPad and put it on my iPhone 7+. Still no meat. Or rather, it simply disappears. Which is pretty much what this game is. Crap.\n\nNow I‚Äôve started THREE bloody games and THEY-DO-NOT-SAVE! This piece of blithering garbage is driving me crazy. How frigging basic can you get? You‚Äôd think with the out-the-ceiling price the least it would be able to do is SAVE! \n\nYou‚Äôd be wrong. Never regretted buying an app so much in my life. And the App Store could care less.\n\nThis app is flawed from beginning to end‚Äîand even the end. Press the button to ‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù. Great, but the only way you‚Äôll get back in is by rebooting your machine. \n\nHave fun!",

Obviously, it plays best on a controller, but considering the constraints of a mobile phone screen, I can‚Äôt criticize the touch controls at all.\nAs for the game itself, I could sing its praise forever. The gameplay is fun and satisfying, the art and music are beautiful, the story and characters are excellent; there‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs one of my all-time favorites.\nIf you‚Äôve never played this game before, I would definitely recommend playing on PC or console first, no question.\nHowever, if you‚Äôre a returning fan, and skeptical of the mobile port like I was, absolutely it is worth getting.",

Don‚Äôt expect difficulty except on harder modes.\n\nThe controls are fluid and the game is polished. This is PC game quality on your phone. I haven‚Äôt been this satisfied with a mobile game since Alto‚Äôs Adventure and these are the only two games I‚Äôve truly enjoyed on my phone. And combat is truly satisfying, especially parries. The voice acting is superb as well. Fidget doesn‚Äôt break the fourth wall nearly as much as some reviewers claim she does.\n\nThe story isn‚Äôt unique, but literally everything else is flawless, and the story is still well presented. It‚Äôs one of those games that leaves an imprint on you long after it‚Äôs finished.\nPS - the normal difficulty isn‚Äôt actually difficult at all. I would recommend the normal difficulty even if you consider yourself a casual or new player to the genre.",

I think it's safe to say most players, myself included, would not assume that this game was the work of a single person. Ignoring subjective opinions regarding the art style, this game is an example of everything a Metroidvania game should be, and more. It's clear that a lot of time & energy went into programming the phenomenal controls. The intuitive movement & actions create a combat that's visceral & satisfying, yet still challenging. I had a blast playing through ths mobile version of this game despite having completed it on the PC.",

Great support for MFI controllers in this game.\n\nAlso, recently the game was given a visual facelift, and it did wonders on my 10.5‚Äù screen.  It looks much better now.  Highly recommend this game, as its one of the best side scrollers on the App Store.  Great story, and a awesome musical score.\n\nThumbs way up!",

This game gives me hope for the Appstore and after all of the clones and cash grabs I've seen, this game is a shining star to those other games. So I recommend buying this game if you want something new. Heck I‚Äôve almost beaten the game while writing this review and that 6 bucks I spent was probably the best 6 bucks I have ever spent on the AppStore. Buy this game, it won‚Äôt disappoint.",

The pc version is also very nice, and one of the best ports done in a long time. The story is so in depth and well done, it's hard to say much wrong about it. It's a very unique beat um up style game, with equipment and so many cool tricks you can do, like the Ariel dust storm. Understanding the games mechanics to find secrets, as well as using clues you got many hours ago is brilliant. Although, one complaint is the game can be a little easy at times, but that problem is solved with harder difficulties. Normal mode was just too easy. Also, the phone doesn't nearly show how good the controls are. On console and pc, the controls feel fluid and tight, making it only your fault for getting hit. The phone is just to hard to control. Overall, it's a great experience, but if you want the true experience, get the console version.",
