This game blew me away, and this game is a lot better than even some of the games on my pc. The story is great, and it is one of the few mobile games that actually has a good storyline. The combat is really good, as it is simple to learn, but you can do so much with it. The campaign is the best part imo, but the challenge and custom maps are also fun. Also, it is really cool unlocking new abilities for your character as you go along. On top of that, to fully upgrade any character it’s only $.99, so the max you can spend in the game is only $9, and you really don’t need to pay anything as it’s not pay to win at all. I have never written a game review before, but this game is so good that I had too.",

One day into the game, I find myself not knowing how to check or accepting a serious flaw in the game. We are unable to view the range for our own units. We are unable view any information about the terrain, also. For instance, clicking or holding your finger on a unit should serve a purpose to display ranged attack length or unit information. Recruiting is annoying because everytime you view a unit, they prompt a 2 sentence pop up of information which increases time to select your unit. We should also be able to station units on saloons or homes. I’m also not sure if ranger attacks can go through them? They’re are so many mesas as well but shouldn’t we be able to place our units on them, or on hills. Also the menu buttons are way to close, they feature similar font and size. So often I will click on a different button than I desire, as they’re placed on the top right. I’d prefer more copy and paste of advance wars , Lost Frontier is old but there is much untapped potential.",

It sometimes takes me four or five tries to beat a level, but that difficulty makes it all the more worth it.\n\nOnly two changes could make the game better: online multiplayer (please!!) and allow achievements to be shared with other living legends. Otherwise, this game is perfect.\n\nJust one more time I have to say that I love the style. The simplicity of the menus, the cartoonish characters, and the satisfying controls.

You can play continue your save stage on iPhone or iPad, switch easily. Don’t worry for lost save process even you lost your iPhone. \n\nBut, I found few little bugs, e.g. enemy hero’s special power disappeared when I restart the game. Unlimited moves in one round, when I click ”end turn” then exit the app from background. And this game had no updates more than 2 years after last update. Even so, it’s my favorite game on my iPhone.\n\nLooking forward lost frontier 2!",

There simply isn’t anything else with this classic TBS format & perfect iPhone play. Kills me that it’s just sitting and growing dusty.\n\nMy favorite iPhone game so far. I have searched obsessively for a turn based strategy game that incorporated terrain, unit types, capturing & defending space and am really glad I finally found Lost Frontier. It’s perfectly formatted for an iPhone screen, is easy to pick up and has alot of depth and enjoyable challenges in the campaigns. My only regret is that having finished the game twice there is no second version to buy. Well worth the trivial price and a great relief from the litany of “free to play” junk. Saddle up!",

I get lost in this game sometimes and the hours just slip by. The more you learn about each of the characters and the posses and the tanks, how they move and the damage they do on others...well, it’s a steady learning curve but so worth the time when you get that Victory! salute from the game. Of all the PlayStation and iOS games I’ve played, this one ranks near the very top. Purchased this a year ago and still playing and enjoying it. I highly recommend this for someone looking for a challenge with a great rewards system. I hope someday soon there is a Lost Frontier 2 because I will instantly pre-order it.",

As far as creativity in solutions, meh. Yeah to get 3 stars you’ll probably be kind of confined in your solution, but it really is more of a puzzle style game if your goal is to 3star every mission. Not a negative, it’s just more of a “solution” based game at that point",

When I heard Mika had made a strategy game, suffice to say I was excited! Sadly though, after playing for about 15 hours I honestly think I’m done with the game for good. The problem isn’t that this game is too hard, it’s that there’s only one “correct” way to do each mission. Basically each map is just a boring game of trial and error till you figure out the exact moves to finish the level with 3 stars. You just don’t get that rush of creative excitement that a fire emblem game affords you. I wish so badly that I could recommend this game to fans of the genre, but truthfully I suggest you pass on this one and try the Partia games if you’re looking for a strategy fix.",

Also, it would be nice to turn off the tutorial and intro dialogue after the first time. \n\nHighly recommended game.  Challenging. Lot of strategy. Nice atmosphere.  In-game purchases are perfect. Sequel please.",

I beat everything with 3 stars and wanted it to be more difficult so I selected Ghast and beat it with 3 stars without using the hero or any of the graveyard units.  I gotta try to beat it without air units now.  It has tons of replay value in my opinion.  Thanks for my favorite game on the App Store!",

This is the most annoying feature missing imo. It's cumbersome to keep dragging the map around to memorize all the position of your enemies\n\n2) No Surrender & Replay on the same level - Sometimes I'd like to start over without having to go back to the main menu\n\n3) No skip button on dialogue - In that vein, if I want to replay a level I don't want to have to tap through all the dialogue",

Keep up the great work! I check up on you on the App Store about once a month, just in case you drop something new. I'm not positive, but I believe this is an indie developer. They only release a new game every year or two. Again, their games are always good though. You are the first and only developer I know by screen name. Keep it up, and I hope you have made a decent living for yourself making these great games!",

Not only is this game mobile I'm so happy that I can have it on my phone to take with me wherever I go and be able to play it with friends (multiplayer) whenever I want. This is possible the greatest app I've ever paid for, $2.99 with no in app purchases is a steal for this sort of game. The units are diverse and bring many fun new ideas to mix that we're all used to in these sorts of games. The game mechanics and rules have been tweaked slightly as well somewhat upping the challenge. I like the new combat system as it now allows for a chance to deal a varied amount of damage each time you attack. The story is good as well. One of my new favorite additions to the genera is the day and night cycle that effects certain units which makes you strategize even more. Some people complain that the levels are far to hard, this is true but they're not impossible although some may take you a few tries (level 9 for instance) you're also able to choose hero characters to command your troops and supply buffs to certain units as well. The music and sound effects are top notch and make me feel like I truly am in the Wild West (when playing with headphones). Basically I love this game and if you've ever played an advanced wars game I know you'll love this one to. No other game has made me ramble on in a review this much.\n\n5/5\n\n10/10 \n\n100/100\n\nA perfect game for a great price",
