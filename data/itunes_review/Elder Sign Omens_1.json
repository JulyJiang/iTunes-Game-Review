Basically you need to choose the CORRECT characters for the mission and to use resources efficiently. But certain adventures (one or two) in the game can be too luck dependent and this is a little bit annoying. DLC contains newly designed adventures and they definitely worse the price. But nevertheless this is the game that you won‚Äôt play twice after you succeed, so it is reasonable to make it difficult. LOL.\n\nP.S. Hint: This game can be soloed with only one investigator and it‚Äôs interesting (and perhaps helpful) to do so, especially when against SOME monster.",

The main issue is that the game itself doesn‚Äôt scale and it‚Äôs too luck-heavy.\n\nThe game sometimes (and usually) starts you off against tasks that require far more preparation and items than you start with, making it near impossible to get the ball rolling. Even if you do manage to beat an early task, the game can easily spiral out of control.\n\nAs with most games involving dice, this game is a little too dependent on luck. Even if you‚Äôre fully stocked and armed to the teeth, you can still scrub out and fail the task, potentially getting killed off right off the bat. There‚Äôs very little strategy involved.\n\nHowever, this app is probably better than buying the actual board game and getting frustrated at how much money you spent on that, so I would recommend the app over the board game if you NEED to play it. All in all, though, save your money and buy something like Ascension instead.",

It's smart, challenging, complex  but also immensely satisfying.\nI played the board game version two or three times with friends and enjoyed it, so I recently decided to pick up the video game version. First off, like the board game, the video game is not a gimme to win. It's a combination of luck, skill, and understanding of the various gameplay tactics. (Backstory, Elder sign is a simplified version of Arkham Horror, which is a six hour marathon of a game). \nIt took me a little while to learn the mechanics of the video game version, like how to focus the glyphs on a roll (basically, save the glyph you want). And it took even longer to get really good at learning how to select teams, how to manage resources like your spell and unique item cards, and how to send the right investigator in for a particular challenge. Sometimes luck isn't on your side and you get bad rolls, or you get loaded up on hard adventures. But sometimes it all comes together and it's much more satisfying for not always being easy.\nI've gotten to the point where I can usually beat the basic games. I liked the game so much that I purchased all three expansions and I have yet to beat any of those, but I'm getting close.\nThe expansions also give you new investigators. The Cthulhu expansion gives awesome investigators, the Alaska one has some good ones, but I wasn't excited about the investigators from the Egypt expansion (although Egypt has my favorite actual gameplay from any expansion). \nIn short, get this if you want to sink your teeth into a game and spend some time building your skills in it. If you want a fast game that you can play a few times, win and move on, it's probably not the right pick.",

Failed adventure. Next adventure, my investigator deploys a red glyph, needs a few Lore rolls, does not get it the entire time. These are easy adventures, impossible to complete because the dice do not ever show what you need.\n\nYes, random dice based games result in this kind of behavior. But for me, this is consistent. Easy was easy, normal so far has been impossible.\n\nI don't chalk this up to deliberate programming as some other reviewers have. I believe this is a bug that needs to be addressed.

Let me tell you why that is, and also why this game is a fantastic little horror gem. I have a deep seated love for the Lovecraft mythos and a general understanding of what a game emulating Lovecraft's themes should include, and this game does it well. \n\nAnyone that says this game is \"too hard\" either 1) doesn't understand the nature of the game or 2) the nature of Lovecraft's works.\n\nLet me address these 2 points. First of all, the nature of the game: the foundation of this game is dice rolls. Your ultimate success is based on chance and is altogether subject to RNG. There are certain guidelines that the game abides by (for example, difficulty levels, investigator selections, tool use timing and risks taken) and there is little that you, as a player, can do to manipulate the random aspects of this game. That doesn't mean you are powerless. As I listed above there are ways you can guide the general direction of the game, and influence ultimate goals, abilities and requirements. \n\nSecond, subject matter. Lovecraft's universe is a scary place and you as a member of the human race most often will end up succumbing to madness and ultimate failure, which you should expect from a cosmic horror game or piece of literature. Even when you \"win\", you're still just a meaningless human that doesn't hold a candle to the madness and chaos that is the eldritch existence and it's implications.\n\nMy first game I had no idea what I was doing and was going on adventures left and right with no thought to what I could do to affect the outcome and often ended in very little success (that is, total failure). I estimate I've about 2 or 3 dozen plays or so. My most recent game played I got to 9 elder signs (of 10 needed... So close!), and pulled an unfortunate combo of 2 doom tokens at the stroke of midnight which put me over the limit and ended the game. So I have gotten close to winning, once.\n\nIt should also be noted that I've only played this game on easy, that is, against Yig, and have yet to beat him. There is plenty of replay value here as long as you expect not to \"win\". You should expect to lose, to fight tooth and nail, to claw your way out of insanity's pit, to assess your last game and try to figure out what you could have done differently, or simply get back on the horse that tossed you for the 50th time.",

Play the easy boss and almost every roll seems to give you what you need.  Move up to the next difficulty boss and suddenly you can even roll a single Investigation (the most abundant result on all the dice) when needed.  \n\nThat's no to say the game can't be won, it just means that the game is PROGRAMMED to stop you.  The difficulty is artificial and has no connection to the boss itself, it's just written into the programming.  \n\nIn other words, you're playing with a cheater. \n\nWhether it's cheating to make you win or cheating to make you lose, it's a disingenuous experience.   Some people may not mind but I can't stand this type of idea in gaming.  And shame on the makers of this game for violating the spirit of gamesmanship.   \n\nSo basically I've had my money stolen by tricksters when I just wanted a way to play this game digitally on the go.

I have a few nitpicks though. \n\nI would have liked a tutorial instead of videos, but after I poked around the menus, I'm extremely happy. \n\nThis one I'm torn on. Expansions are cool and all, but the three expansions they offer here are actually the complete core game from the table top. Or at least two are. After seeing that, I felt like I paid for an incomplete game. HOWEVER: this game is a lot cheaper than most table top translation games (by half almost) so, I kind of like the idea that I'm buying a smaller version to see if I like it. Which I do. And I will buy the expansions. \n\nSo, that's my cons, my pros are that its every bit the experience you get from the table top playing solo. \n\nI highly recommend the game.",

These sort of board games needs to be fully understood prior to judgement, learn the rules to the game, then play it. \n\nWhy I'm so appreciative that ffg released this app is because I was hesitant of purchasing the board game due to how complex the gameplay might be. After playing (and learning the game) for a couple days and went right out and bought the hard copy. The gameplay on the hard copy is just as amazing, if not more. I recommend that as well! \n\nLEARN THE GAME, THEN PASS JUDGMENT.",

It's certainly more difficult than the board game, with a few of the mechanics being different, but I love it! You have to know the game. Know the characters and what each is capable of. It is not just luck. It is luck mixed with strategy and understanding of odds. Yes, sometimes you'll get awful rolls, but that happens when playing with real dice, too. Be smart about your play, and you can get the upper hand. Seriously, I play a LOT of different tabletop game, including every one of FF's Lovecraftian games, and they all have some element of luck to them. On this app, I win about 60% of the time, but it's a challenge every time! Don't buy it, or any Fantasy Flights game for that matter, if you don't want to work hard for your wins! :)",

From what I understand the board game is difficult as well, but at the table, with friends, you can bond over the stress and take great pleasure in the rare win.\n\nThat DOES NOT translate over to a mobile game where the majority of the games played will be solo. You can employ strategies to not loose as fast, but that's it. You have NO control over the game results because the success or failure is determined by random glyph generation. So this game is nothing more than a glorified slot machine. \n\nYour good performance and smart game play WILL NOT BE REWARDED because you can't stop the progress of the old ones. \n\nI like FFG, and play some of their games, but this game? \n\nUTTER GARBAGE.",

Not only that but it seems like the midnight effect adds too many doom track tokens. I have not one a single game and I've only played with Yig as the Ancient One and he's supposed to be \"easy\" this game needs a major update on glyph rolls or the glyph requirements per adventure and stop making the midnight effect add 2 doom tokens!!!!",
