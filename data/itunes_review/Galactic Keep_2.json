The game involves turn-based combat and while there is some randomness due to the dice there is also plenty of strategy. Knowing when to use an item, a special skill, or when it is time to flee, are all key. \nYou do have to enjoy reading to get the most out of this game. Throughout there is text describing what you're seeing and doing. I don't think you can fully experience the game unless you take the time to read these text pieces. That's not a problem though because they are very well written and fun. Fans of the Sorcery series should really love this. While not a game book like Sorcery both appeal to the bookworm and gamer in me.\nThe music that is here is cool I just wish it was used more often. I also wish the text font was a little bit larger. When there is black text against a red background it can be a little difficult to read. I hope more modules are forthcoming as well. There's one so far and it seems pretty lengthy. I've sunk a couple of hours into it and I get the feeling I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nUpdate: finished the module and loved every minute. The only problem: I really really want to play more modules! Here's hoping there's a content update soonish.",

It does let you choose another character and continue, but not much point when the new character is of the original skill level.   I had a level-13 character die after hours of playing.  I chose a new character (which came in at level 6) and it died within 5 minutes.  There is no Save capability I have found.   I am simply not going to replay those 6-10 hours I've already played.   It was fun up until then, but I've deleted the app and moved on now.  I know some will cheer a 'hardcore' modee like this, but for me this just isn't fun.",

I felt like it was 1985 again, I was hanging out with Billy and Michael in our kitchen late at night playing a new scifi RPG we had just bought that day. The dice roll, the faux game rules designed to look like old 1980's rules, the top down drawn maps, it all just clicked, and mostly in a good way. The maps could have been a bit more distinct and colorful and although the character and enemy artwork was ok, it could have been better. The water color vagueness of the enemies and characters made it hard at times to really understand what I was looking at.  The game is short and contained to just about three locations, mostly small. The game mechanics are interesting but I didn't care too much to explore the other characters and only used a few to finish the short story. If the art were more distinct and the story more epic and expansive, and the characters more different, it could be a five star game. But now, it's just ok. Really loved the nostalgia though.... Sigh...",

It's a clever approach that's easy to pick up and just has that feel of encountering the next monster in a dungeon, even though the setting is SF. Here are some observations after 3 victories (out of 4 games). \n\n-- BIOT, I actually won a game (2nd one I started) before I realized you can heal your character some by not using all moves on your die roll. I was constantly switching between characters as old ones died and muttering angrily about the scathing review I was going to write. Then, after winning, I read the online help and thumped my forehead. \n\n-- There are some clever combinations of 'special attacks' and weapons that you'll discover. \n\n-- At first I thought there were too many goodies available, but since you have a limit as to what you can carry, it means you have to constantly prioritize (or use up) what you have. After my first few games, I became much better at simply leaving stuff behind or dropping it off. \n\n-- While some of the weapons are great, many are indistinguishable from one another in actual play. Likewise, many  that show up later in the game are too low level.  And, frankly, the explosive grenades are almost useless; you use your entire turn to 'throw' one, it explodes a few turns later, and the damage it does is minimal. \n\n-- One the other hand, one or two of the weapons are almost overpowered, particularly the sword that allows you to steal from your opponent. A few swings of that sword against an enemy who uses an actual weapon, and he's fighting you with bare hands and with no healing solutions. Of course, to get that sword, you have to fight and defeat the (IMHO) toughest and most irritating enemy, The Stranger (who is constantly stealing _your_ stuff). So I guess it evens out.\n\n-- There's no way to maintain different sets of characters. Once you've completed the (single) module, your only two options are to (a) start over from scratch or (b) play the module again with the characters as they existed when you completed the module. Since the next module will use your characters as they currently exist, you don't want to get rid of one who had developed well -- but that limits your opportunity for experimentation. \n\n-- We need that 2nd module ASAP. :-)",

At the default difficultly, the game encourages exploration and is incredibly mobile-gamer friendly. You can pick it up and put it down with no loss of progress. I've finished the first mission twice and cannot wait for additional content. This is easily the best iOS game I've played in several years.",

Maybe after a patch. \n\nLoses one star, the game itself because\n\n1. Near as I can tell, you get one save slot. One. Maybe two but I could only get one to work. \n2. One stat point per level combined with random rolls equals bad game design. That's a whole lot of effective level divergence from the get. One pip = one very slow to attain level. I worked the table top industry for years. I've seen this before. \n3. While the game says you have six:seven races:classes, (or v/v idk) effectively you don't. You pick from a base of pre made class race combos. Little misleading there.  \n4. Range means nothing in this game at least as far as I can tell. You have to be on top of the enemy or adjacent. \n\nOn the upside. Very good old school flavor.  Some pretty simple but subtle mechanics and if you're going for template based , the races and classes are pretty original and mechanically distinct and significant. \n\nDon't count them out. It's still early. The lost progress from crashes is the only deal breaker. Uninstalled for that reason. 2 stars and do not recommend only for that reason and the ones listed prior.

Enemies differ wildly on level/difficulty all on the same map.  Some enemies are + 5 and +11 in comparison to the player.  Get too close and they hunt you down and murder you.  Leveling from level 6 to 7 took a lot of kills and trying to stay healthy is difficult.  A rest or camp option would be nice.  As it is the available heals for robot characters doesn't keep pace with the need for healing in and out of combat at the moment.  I wish this game great success and hope they make it a bit more balanced.",

I would love to give this game a five star review, but with the expansive map and multiple enemies, it would be very nice to be able to zoom in and out from your character along with being able to look around the map. That's the only aspect that I feel could be truly improved. Thanks for the stellar game otherwise.",
