It’s a very thought immersing, sophisticated, well put together and designed strategy game. \n\nThe story, characters, lore, the items even are memorable, and the places you have traveled definitely will give you either fond memories or bad memories. \n\nThose memories and feelings can change quickly for one event that was previously not explored, or even a spell, or a different conversation can and will result in different reactions. \n\nI have so far, gotten through Sorcery One and half through Sorcery two, I did try Sorcery three and stopped to finish the second. I can’t wait to finish them all and play again. \n\nYou do not need thought provoking applications or memories and brain enhancing apps. Strategy, euphoria, thinking five, six and sometimes well ahead, while being mindful to a common person and just as cautious with what appears benign, but being open to take risks progress you in so many facets and ways in your mind and the game. \n\nIt is in many senses, almost a game that can be utilized as a very seldom life experience for real life. Always be careful in all situations but live your life and have fun always while listening to all your senses and feelings.\n\n Your mind is the present, logic, and memories or reason. Your heart is what guides you and the present moment to always be aware of and follow. Your gut is instinct and the future. \n\nAlways remember that and it will be understood in time to know if your heart and mind are being tricked by something you can’t see if your gut is telling you no. Or if your gut says yes and your heart is weary is only telling you to proceed guarded but with courage. Always rationalize and never listen to anything but your internal voice. If it doesn’t feel right. It’s not. \n\nI guess I’ve been playing this game too much. Well. Back to it.  Thank you!!!!",

This one is smart, well-written and incredibly enhanced compared to the original book. This is simply one the best mobile games I have ever played—and undoubtedly the best RPG game on a mobile platform I have ever seen.

Also, the interface and interaction feel more polished than the previous games.

Sorcery 3 is definitely one of the more tedious and aggravating games on the App Store.  Did the developers test their product by actually playing it through?  There's no point to anything - no point to spending gold on food as it is lost one or two turns later; no point in obtaining helpful items as they are lost or stolen one to two turns later, no point in making choices as the game will steer you where it wants you regardless. There is very little action and interaction, and much of ones times is spent walking, walking, walking, swimming.  \n\nI should reveal that I did not actually finish the game; I was wasn't able to.  If you die at a place where the \"rewind\" feature is not an option, then you you have to start from the beginning.  That means hours and days of progress utterly wasted.  The story unfolds too slowly and the intermittent rewards are too underwhelming to make restarting worthwhile.  \n\nIf you are on there fence about whether or not to play this latest installment, save your money.",

Unfortunately that patch made it so that the CTD happens on game start, every single time. \n\nThe game works on my 5s, so it seems to be a processor issue. The game should state up front that its incompatible with the original iPad mini.",

They were so much more in-depth than \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books and took a more mature approach to things: the story was intriguing, there was so much to explore and you got to act like an actual adventurer casting spells and battling monsters. It felt like a less complicated, single player D&D campaign. Playing this again on my iPhone has been a blast. I love having more visuals to enjoy while roaming about, while inkle still preserved the great original artwork. The \"twist\" of being able to change the topography with special items is particularly eye-catching. And of course the writing holds up to this day. This series is a true gem and if you're a fantasy fan you owe it to yourself to see these classics glossed up and presented in such a fun format. Something else to note, I've always appreciated that you can play an adventurer of either gender and inkle has retained this option. So often you're stuck playing as a male in other (modern!) games yet here a series decades old was bright enough to offer such a simple yet considerate choice.",

                    "label": "Some small notes based on other reviews:  yes this game eats battery like crazy. \n\nTo beat the time serpent, find the clue near the middle of the map. It's all about time after all. Trust me when you figure it out you'll find yourself wondering why you didn't think of that. \n\nAnd as a side note no one asked about. I bought these games for the kindle fire also. Your passwords work across systems. Happy gaming everyone!\n\nSo the review!\n\nOkay! After having played through twice, and poked at the beginning of a third time I figure I can leave a more detailed review.\n\nLike another reviewer said, the game truly IS open world. \n\nI did contact them to ask about whether it's possible to save the fractured world you travel through, and they said no as of yet no.  But they said that one particular encounter was reported as a bug quite often when I mentioned i enjoyed it.  There is ONE encounter where going backwards will NOT let you make new choices.  Instead the person you are talking to says the equivilent of \"Really? You tried to rewind time? NAH TOO BAD.\"  When I tried this i laughed so much.  Each serpent has a weakness.  And you can even TRICK them sometimes.  Though when I tricked the moon one he found me again later, so that's probably not the greatest idea.  They introduced new mechanics.  The slider to take you back in choices to help facilitate the fact that you will want to  retrace your steps several times sometimes (I kept going to sleep in a particular tower that was safe because well.   It was safe.  Sleeeping out in the middle of nowhere isn't safe!)  There's now counter spells, which actually are helpful!!  You'll learn them if you talk to the right people.  There's also a shop where you can make a ton of gold if you play it right. I walked out of there with over 150 gold.  The ending is...something else.  I was staring at the screen feeling vaguely horrified over it. But that's a tale for Sorcery! 4.\n\nThe best items to get from the first two games are the mirror, skullcap, and green haired wig.  Good luck finding them (The mirror and wig i found in sorcery! 2.  I BELIEVE I found the skullcap in 1...I forget.) But if you do have those items, they make a lot more options appear.  \n\nNow I never read the books back in the 80's.  I didn't have the money to buy them back then. (I got $5 a month for allowance and they never showed up at the used bookstore I bought paperbacks at.) If you want an idea of how good these games are, game vloggers on youtube were playing through them.  They're usually super snobby about mobile games.\n\nI had a few crashes, nothing major.  I was playing on an iphone 5s though, not an ipad mini.    This game does eat battery like it's a college football team at a buffet though, and I found myself running out of battery on my phone after around  four hours of play, which is something for a mostly text game.  Also, I can't play my own music in the background, which does make me sad. It's not worth taking a star though, as the other two are the same way.",
