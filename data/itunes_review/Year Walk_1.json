But these are probably the best $4 I‚Äôve spent in the App Store. This game deserves a larger following and all the purchases it can. Its premise is original, the controls are smooth, the illustrations stunning, and the myths behind it are intriguing. This is among my favorite games, and my #1 iOs horror game hands down.",

I think the use of the journal in the companion was genius and really hooked me. There are too many great things to even mention about the game in this one review! The only thing I think that could be improved upon is the IOS version of the game could use a map to navigate the landscape, but even then it‚Äôs not a necessity because you get used to the terrain eventually and find your way. I loved this game so much; I can only hope the other horror games I intend to delve into can deliver such a grand atmosphere and greatness as this game has!",
