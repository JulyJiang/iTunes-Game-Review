In a future update, please add the ability to change your gear when you first enter a level. That way you won’t have to take the extra time to flee the level and go back to the inn to equip new gear and you can spend more time playing! Thank you!!",

This certainly added a level of complexity to the game, but made it difficult to play.

I wanted some alternative to candy crush/toon blast etc: Casual games that are fun to play in quick opportunities. This game fails to match those for a ton of reasons:\n-gameplay is repetitive: 90+levels in, the enemies and objectives never change. The artwork never changes. Level 95 has the exact same action as level 1. Boring. \n-artwork also never changes. \n-takes forever to launch on my iPhone x10s-3x longer than the other games mentioned \n-the battery gets absolutely obliterated. I have no idea HOW they attack my battery like they do, but playing it for too long can destroy your battery\n-the things you earn throughout the game “blueprints” are not fun; most consume resources to re-use, but the levels don’t necessitate you needing them, there is no making your character “better.” Or more able to handle other enemies that he will face later. You just just slightly different tools to do the same thing you could before. \n\nI did give it two stars because the artwork is pretty decent.\n\n I sure wish they would have had a lot more levels-larger grids, puzzles to resolve, things that felt CRAFTED instead of randomly generated.  \n\nOh and your text is simultaneously too hard to dismiss and too easy.  Don’t explain how to to defeat the level boss each level. I know how, because it’s exactly the same as the last xx levels.  (Sigh.)\n\nCapy, if you’re reading this: you have half the game you should here. I see you’re launching for switch. Good luck, but if I were you I’d deliver a game that pays off for longer play with things like: more new enemies as it goes on, more different boss fights. (What is this an exit blocking review?) and for the love fix the battery issue and boot times. Why does it take so long???",

The levels gradually increase in difficulty, just like a game should, BUT it periodically throws in some easier levels too. Even though I’ve played this game for months, it never fails to make me giggle to hear the sound effects at the end of the level when you slap the king to get the crown. I’m grinning just typing this! Kudos to the developers for creating such a fun game and updating it regularly. I plan on checking out other games from this developer because I am so impressed. Great Job!",

I’m thinking the creators of Star vs the Forces of Evil must’ve had something to do with this, the style reminds me of it heavily. And the music in this game is crazy! Premium game music. The only complaint I have is the inn. It’s annoying that it takes so long to simply refill your hearts, I wish you could get in and get out and not have to wait for the bartender to pour it N u to drink it. I’m sad this is only available on Apple Arcade, I don’t think I could justify paying for it monthly but I would totally buy this game on its own. A shame😢",

No point...Unless you earn rewards.\nMake them small so that people still need to grind.\n\nIt’s just frustrating that when visiting earlier levels, it takes too much time to simply earn gems again and buy health.\n\nPeople have not been able to add anybody to their GC list except since iOS 9. The point is that most people don’t even know who they are competing with.\n\nOther than that, excellent job adding all of the levels, but consider the more appropriate and fitting retention suggestion without a question. 👍😎",

However, the graphics and animations make this game one of the best on Apple Arcade.\n\nThe Inn is one of the best parts of the game. The Armory is amazing, and Blueprints are a good addition to the game. The dressing closet is also really cool, but there should probably be more outfits. ( Maybe a winter outfit where Jorj is wearing a super puffy jacket that squishes his face.\n\nBut then... there’s the bar. The Bar is useful, and I wouldn’t be at the level I’m at today if it weren’t for the bartender. But there is nothing interesting about it. It has a little animation, and it gives you health. That’s all. \n\nThis is where a suggestion comes in; Bar Fights. You would do a level of medium difficulty, and if you win, you get either a chest, blueprints, or 10 - 20 Grindstones. If you can’t beat the level, you lose a heart. That’s it! Great game overall.\n\nBtw it would be cool if there was something called a Crackhead, maybe a jerk, Idk. But it would basically attack angry creeps and bosses. But if you got too close it can kill you too.",

If they would allow the character to heal up between matches like some of the power ups rather than “pay” stones to heal back up it would be more addictive. I usually reach a difficult level and begin to run out of stones in order to keep playing. The thought of going back to early lesser levels becomes unappealing and I stop playing. The potential is there because graphics are great and the game play is fun unfortunately part of the game play keeps players from grinding on this game.  One other drawback is that upgrades cost  significant amounts of your inventory items (some of which are the stones required to gaining health) so it’s this endless cycle of trying to gain items to continue on playing and upgrading your stuff rather than advancing through the levels. Awesome concept for a game but too many small things keep you from REALLY enjoying it.",
