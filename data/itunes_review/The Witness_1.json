There are some parts where the slightly janky controls become frustrating, and there are some parts where doing a puzzle with your finger actually blocks part of the screen where the puzzle is. But 99% of this game is comfortably playable on mobile, and of course the $10 price tag makes the 1% of frustration easier to swallow. I’m quite impressed with whoever was responsible for porting this. Great job! \n\nI will say that if you have the choice to play this on console or PC (maybe MacOS as well?), you absolutely should because the visuals in this game are very nice to look at and having a bigger screen with better graphics to show them off will make the 20-80 hours you spend with this game more enjoyable. And a mouse/keyboard is the optimal input method for this game as well, although I will admit that being able to touch the panel puzzles is a pretty cool gimmick.",

It was easy to re-enter where I left off by selecting start and choosing the last saved “game”. The Caves was quite unexpected; loved it. I am not into intense gaming but love exploring, so Witness was spot on for me.\n\nHowever, I found the puzzle panels to be tedious after a while. Just way too many of them. The Quarry is my favorite because it had more variation in getting around, not just puzzle panels. The least favorite was Shady Trees. The audios were interesting but the videos not so much.\n\nIt was worth the cost even though I did not complete everything there was to do; but did almost all. Thanks to Theica and Mr. Blow!

I tried to avoid the spoilers & looked only for guides, but couldn't find a single guide that explained the rational behind some of the puzzles, as if the reviwer him/herself didn't know eeither. One is very often forced to guides that seem disoriented & incomplete, a refelction of the comvultion of the game. Anyways, even though it cost me about $10, I figured cut my losses was best to avoid the torment of back-&-forth betweeen the game and intenet searches for advice. I deleted it away.",

Tired of the “puzzle” mechanics. You have to line things up just perfectly to get it, which is near impossible because the controls.

I have near 100% completion (497 panels and 46 environmental puzzles) and will 100% the game, but it’ll probably take a walkthrough. Up until now, I’ve only needed one once in the shadow based area. This game is great, but bad at communication. I feel like a lot of the aha moments could become pure frustration to someone who doesn’t understand them. If you don’t understand a concept, the game will NOT guide you. It will simply cross it’s arms and shake its head. So why is it 5 stars? Because my experience with the game was amazing, and because this will most likely not happen to you. The game is phenomenal, from the opening to the end, it’s full of thought-provoking puzzles and ideas. Granted, don’t get the plot, it’s an unnecessary part of the game, but it’s still there if you want it. I LOVE this game (except the Jungle and shipwreck, they can rot in Hell, but they’re optional unless you want secrets). The way that some puzzles have parts covered by something or are changed by color is ingenious to me. The way the mountain flips the ideas on their head, making the puzzles move, messing with perspective, obscuring certain parts, giving you a seizure, making looping puzzles, it all feels very Baba is You esque, but without the Baba is you, and with waaaaaay better visuals. The ideas are communicated mostly by showing you an oversimplified puzzle with no prior knowledge, the player trail-and-erroring the first super-simple puzzle, figuring out the rule, and then applying the rule in super complicated ways. This is how the jungle, quarry, zen gardens, orchard, keep, marsh, bunker, and more teach you their principles, and it’s an effective yet ineffective way of doing things. I assumed a tutorial would be somewhere, and as a result was stumped for the first 3 hours of the game in the town because since it’s right there, you would think it’s the next area, but I gave up and then realized it’s close to the endgame. Other than the few problems, the game is almost perfect, but also absolutely infuriating. Great game, don’t recommend.",

Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve, but the developers have done a great job of teaching you everything you need to know to solve each different TYPE of puzzle.\n\nAnd to the pedants who insist that the puzzles are all the same just because you draw a line path to solve each one, you couldn’t be more wrong. The “Rules” for each category of puzzle vary dramatically, and get progressively more difficult, as well as being further combined in interesting and even more difficult ways. Indeed, much of the difficulty/fun is discovering exactly what the rules are. In the beginning, it is usually pretty obvious and unambiguous how the pieces interact with each other and how the lines must be drawn. But as the game progresses, it is very possible to have a slightly wrong interpretation but still be able to solve a few “easy” puzzles in the progression — only to find that something doesn’t work as you expected and you have to rethink everything. But it is these “AHA” moments that provide the most fun and are unexpectedly delightful.\n\nAnd there are a lot of joyful surprises when you suddenly notice a (obvious in hindsight) clue that allows you to do something almost magical and discover something new. And, IMHO, the best part is that I have not yet encountered ANY brute force type problems (which I hate). There are only a few that require something other than pure logic and I’ve been able to find the appropriate “clue” by simply exploring the glorious, beautiful, gigantic environment and paying careful attention. \n\nFive Stars is not enough!!",

You are playing the same game on both devices, which is very cool. Unfortunately there seems to be a bug that causes the devices not to keep in sync (so you may solve some puzzles on one device but the other device shows a previous state with less puzzles solved). \n\nHere’s the problem: If you start playing on the device that shows the older state you will lose all the progress on the other device (they will both sync to the older state). So you appear to lose any progress you made. I had solved the entire Keep set of puzzles and thought I had lost them all. Blech.\n\nLuckily the various states are stored and you can reload (go to the main menu and hit Load Game).\n\nEarlier review:\n\nProfessionally executed, but as others have said, the puzzles are repetitive (you draw lines in maze like patterns, over and over again).",

I was very disappointed to see that there is no option for virtual sticks which cripples the game. Touch to walk is so cumbersome. I’ve been playing for about five hours trying see if I could acclimate to the control scheme. I understand trying to push a touch to walk control scheme for a cleaner interface, but for a game that was not designed with a touch screen in mind, players need options for controls. I recommend buying this game on any other platform, but not for IOS, unless this issue is resolved",

But the god awful controls are really aggravating. Touch to walk has never been a good idea. You can never move smoothly, it feels so clunky. Especially for a game where it’s all about being aware of your surroundings, you are constantly distracted by the fact that you always have to be constantly tapping where you want to go rather than, so your focus becomes tunnel vision. You are always fighting the controls, since you may tap one place but the game registers as another and your character is constantly moving to places you don’t want to. This is especially aggravating when going up or down stairs. I have no idea how they thought that not including the option for a virtual d-pad was a good idea at all. \n\nI love everything else about this game, but the controls too much in the way to fully enjoy it. Some music would’ve been nice too, to break off the monotony of going through puzzle after puzzle.",

I have a new iPad Pro that is just begging to be used for gaming like this, but then checking the App Store page reminds me that its most recent update was well over a year ago. New devices, no luck. They just pushed this to the store and left it there. \n\nI see this all too often in big-name App Store releases and there’s no backlash or accountability for it. It’s disheartening as a fan of these games and this kind of model.\n\nUpdate: Thanks, team, my review was seen loud and clear! This has been updated and I greatly appreciate the extra attention and TLC given to this port. Cheers! I changed my review from 1 to 5 stars. 🎈",

This is a game about discovery and about learning to see things in a different way, even your own mental processes and the model we have of the world.",

I love it except for one big problem—many puzzles rely on lining up elements in a scene so that from a particular point of view, the puzzle solution can be seen.  On a touchpad it can take an painfully long time to get precisely the correct position and camera angle to line things up correctly.  A bit off with your panning, move a bit too far forward or back, left or right, and you won’t see the solution.\n\nIf you play this, do yourself a favor and use a keyboard rather than a touchscreen .  Spending 40 minutes failing to get the right viewing angle without any way of doing small correction nudges with arrows really spoils the game.",

I’ve left this game (because I’d get stuck on a puzzle and get frustrated, and didn’t want to cheat) and come back again and again because there’s simply no game this amazing on iOS. The Witness is a great experience. The touch controls are completely usable, but I recently purchased an iOS-compatible game controller. The Witness takes full advantage of it — even allowing the player to solve puzzles with the cursor from the console version of the game. Speaking of the console version, the graphics of this game are marvelous. The iOS version retains all of the beauty of the console version. Keep in mind that objects don’t have the highest polygon counts you’ve ever seen — quite the opposite. But that’s the case on every platform. The beautiful low-polygon style makes each shape feel more beautifully carved out of stone. \n\nIf you’re looking for a challenging puzzle game, this blows any competition out of the water. There are just a huge number of puzzles with completely different methods to solving them, but all with the same design language throughout. \n\nBy the way, reviews of this game probably contain spoilers about a special kind of puzzle in the game that you’ll want to find out about without being spoiled. When I did, listening to one of the audio clips in the game and piecing it together with my brother, it was a genuinely euphoric experience. \n\nOh, and when playing this game, I recommend taking notes. Lots of them. I used the Notes app to make a comprehensive field guide of sorts for myself. I took screenshots and wrote detailed descriptions of how a puzzle with certain characteristics needed to be solved. An example (without spoiling anything): I had a note about black hexagons in puzzles. Then I didn’t play the game for months and forgot what they meant. So I just used Spotlight search and typed “black hexagons” and my note on the subject appeared. This can be really useful, and if you forget how to solve the puzzles you already have solved before it can make the game virtually impossible to beat without cheating.\n\nAlso drawing the puzzles that I couldn’t solve in my Notes app (don’t forget to use the ruler to make your grid) helped me to figure some of them out. Including some of the very hardest in the game. It was always fun when someone would see me thinking hard about something and I’d show them the absolutely wild sketch of a puzzle I was working on, and explain all the various and complex rules behind how to solve it, then watch them try, and then try some more, then look confused, and give up. \n\nBasically, this game is a delight, and I’m so very glad I bought it. It’s genuinely even brought me closer to friends and family trying to solve puzzles together. And on an iOS device, I can do that with them anywhere.",

This is great for most puzzles but a decent chunk require you to stand in an exact spot in order to solve and it is pretty much impossible to finely alter your stance with the point and click controls.
