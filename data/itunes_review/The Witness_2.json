Then I looked it up and it said that it is all about physical orientation and lighting. So then I go back to the game and I move around and I get the first one and then after that I could barely see anything with the light reflecting puzzles. So for those I had to just keep guessing until I got up to one of  the puzzles. I was so confused because that was about secret patterns through lighting and I could not see anything. One solution would be too put little spots on the ground so we know where to look or make us be able to see the pattern at a wider angle. Otherwise it is a good game with fun puzzles (not desert ruins) and it makes me use my brain a lot. For ten dollars this game should really have no issues and developers should fix any problems on the reviews (not saying you have to answer mine immediately). I hope this gets fixed.",

The game starts out slow, presenting a segment of the world I am in where board-like puzzles are everywhere and solving them is absolutely crucial to advance. I wasn’t thrilled when my first impression was that it’s going to be like solving these puzzles in a beautiful park for the entire game.\n\nHowever, things start to impress me once I get to explore how vast, how mysterious, and how eye-poppingly beautiful the whole island is. There are moments I even think to myself, after seeing all kinds of beautifully created locations that I know a lot of love has been put into, that even just “sightseeing” around the entire island alone is already worth the money.\n\nOnce I get intrigued by the beauty of the island, the puzzles become the reward of what I get to see and explore further. The story also unfolds slowly. The best part is: I have now come to love these board puzzles, for its ever-evolving nature throughout the game, and its cleverness put into them.\n\nThis is not a game to binge, to play it all in one sitting. It’s a game to take it slow. Play it now and then. Solve some puzzles, walk around, enjoy Einstein’s quotes dubbed by an electrifying voice, and then put the game down for a while. Do that for a few days, and I can guarantee that you will walk away with something you love about this game.",

                    "label": "This game has a lot of 5 star qualities. The pros: The map for one is huge and wandering around is fun. Stumbling on to new puzzles is exciting. And periodically you get some interesting information on the story line. The graphics are pretty good for an iPhone game. Not great, but still pretty cool. The amount of puzzles in the game is staggering. Those are all the positives. \nThe cons: this game is aggravating. I consider myself to be good at puzzles and pretty smart and I have a rough time with many of them. To the point where I had to start relying on walk throughs to help me. And in some cases the puzzles are so annoying they almost make you give up on the game. There are also environmental puzzles that are freaking impossible to find or do unless you have a walk through. I don't think a single person can do this game on their own. It's also very tedious at times and all of the puzzles are nearly the same. It gets old after a while. Honestly if it wasn't for my stubbornness I would quit. So, it has its good qualities and it's bad. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth all the hassle if I'm not really having fun. The discovering part is really fun but the puzzles are so tedious and boring. Once I finish the game I'll update this review.",

And it rewards you for wandering, looking, tinkering, and I find how often the game pats you on the back so satisfying. There are secret videos that absolutely make the searching for answers so gratifying. I recommend this to lovers of world wandering and puzzle solving.

But the more I explored, and discovered, and solved, I realized I was wrong.  This is one of the best games I’ve ever played.\n\nThe more I played, the more I was in awe of the developers imagination and implementation.  I can remember a few OMG moments in games I’ve played over the years:  In Myst when I suddenly found myself on a completely different island for the first time; in Obsidian when I realized I was working my way around the inside walls of a cube.  And in The Witness, after playing for a month, all of a sudden I saw another completely different aspect of the game.  It was there all along, I just hadn’t noticed it yet.  Wow!\n\nThis is a game for explorers and puzzle solvers.  It takes a person with patience, a hunger for discovery, and lots of perseverance.  If that is you, this game will reward you with daily surprises and delights.\n\nI finished it today—well, I got to an end.  But I haven’t solved everything, so I’m not really finished.  There are messages still to find.  I can see places I haven’t explored yet (a door to an unexplored room is locked from the inside, for instance).  So I am continuing to explore, in hopes I can discover more.",

Please fix.\n\n[Update] The puzzle works, but you have to back-track your line (back to the start) and extend it again at the point when you can extend it beyond the initial length... agitating, considering it’s slow moving to test the puzzle over and over again.

The recordings and videos discussing mainly god, wine, glass and encouraging the listener not to look for things in this level of a game where you are required to look for things, were purely waste of time that a listener will never get back. Developers, why did you bring religion into your game? Gamers do not waste your time with the recordings and the videos. The puzzles were primitive and some did not follow their own logic. A lot of time is lost by simply moving from area to area. I was working on both the main puzzle and the hidden puzzles, however, after taking the ridiculous flying elevator ride, where you were told it was just a dream, it erased my game progress and took me back to the beginning. (Spoiler alert: the flying elevator is the game’s end point, without any warning). There is no way to save the game on the iPad Pro in the settings. It is all gone, as if I have never played it - frustrating. The graphics are mediocre at the best, somewhat outdated. The game was definitely not designed by anyone with the knowledge of modern gaming technology. I was hoping for something more intellectual and entertaining and this game definitely missed the mark. Can you call shadows a puzzle? Drawing of simple figures on a grid resembled the basic computer programming- sad. Not much of a puzzle. Furthermore, what is with the shape of the hidden puzzles? Head and the tail. How is finding a repetitious shape a puzzle? Not to mention, the bird pitch sounds. How are the bird sounds a puzzle? Do you warn hearing impaired people that they will not be able to solve the bamboo forest and an area in the hedge maze without being able to hear? Disappointing and primitive.

Yea thanks for adding this game to your App Store, Apple....god I wish I never purchased and played this..\n\nUpdate: WHAT A JOKE this game won “best game of 2017 on iPad”...firstly, this game came out on pc and consoles....secondly, it’s highly pretentious and overrated (just look at overall score of 3.9)...’splitter critters’ DESERVED its award as it did something unique and was a mobile exclusive...shame on you again Apple, for not picking a more deserving game over the witness (aka the pretentiousness)...the TALOS PRINCIPLE is LEAGUES better in puzzle design, graphics, actual intelligence, etc. (if you are going to still go with a game that was on pc first)",

This would have been an A+ game if the puzzles were more varied, not the same trace a line on a screen. They became more difficult and almost impossible, but were still the same type of puzzle. Do that for 20% or even 40% of the game but incorporate completely different types of puzzle tasks as well. I got bored doing the same thing.  I had to bump my rating up a notch for the enlightening movie film clips. Brilliant. The cave was a delight as well. \nI will hope to see a Witness 2 with varied tasks and puzzles.
