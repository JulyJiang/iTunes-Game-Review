It’s quick, arcade-y rogeulike gameplay with its intuitive simple controls and gameplay make it perfect to play on your phone. The combo system allows its surface simplicity to actually have a lot of depth and challenge. It really is the best mobile game no doubt, 5 stars. However, I do have complaints. As a UX change, I wish you could also turn off sound-effects. You can turn off background music, but it’s pretty annoying when you’re trying to listen to music and you hear the little beeps and boops. As an actual gameplay complaint, while I really appreciate the simplicity I do wish their were more upgrades with more diversity. The very few in the game feel somewhat limited after enough gameplay. They haven’t updated this game in a year so I really hope they make a sequel with more content. This game is truly amazing and if you’re gonna have 1 game on your phone it should be Downwell.",

The game is minimalist in the best way: the 3 color graphics (with your choice of unlockable palettes) instantly convey what you can land on and what is better avoided, and the single button (besides left and right movement) that combines jumping and shooting gives you a surprising amount of agility that allows you to strategize your ammo as you assess on-the-fly whether to plunge ahead to preserve a combo or to take your time and plan your next jump. This leads to this version’s major fault that cost it a star: you can turn off the visibility of the onscreen buttons, but unless you have an external controller, your own thumbs are still going to be blocking your vision of what threats you’re about to pounce onto or dodge! If only there was an option to switch the button zones to the top of the screen with the threats you’ve already passed.  \n\nStill great game, though!",

The first 3 are Downwell, Matcha, and Aqua (red, green, and blue respectively), these palettes don’t change anything but the primary color. I would add more palettes, so we can have yellow, purple, orange, and pink types of these, or even a custom palette maker. I know you get Nikaido later on, but it isn’t true to the core 3 because it changes the background. Other than that it’s a great game, add a “tip the dev” in-app purchase so I can give you more money, if the dev(s) are listening.",

You can set the buttons to be invisible but your fingers still need to sit on top of them. This is a game where you fall down. However your character is on the middle of the screen and your fingers are on the bottom. You have a tiny portion of the real estate on the screen to play the game, meaning most of the screen is wasted showing you what's above you. Which doesn't matter nearly as much as what's below. What's worse is that the tap left or right controls are much less accurate than sliding your finger left or right, which would be a much better method of control. Worst of all is that the game is advertised as having elegant controls. The irony is just too much.  On top of this, the description says things you gather on your trips stack. They absolutely do not. You reset everything every time. The only element of progression is unlocking new colors and character traits. Disappointing because the same early levels over and over get boring quickly.",

I’ve had an iPhone since the iPhone 2 was released, and as weird as it feels to say this, Downwell is my favorite game I have ever played on an iPhone. I loved games in the 80s, particularly Metroid which this game was obviously inspired by, so the style of this game is exactly what I’ve missed and wanted out of a pocket sized pick up and put down game. The music is perfect, the color theme is perfect, the characters and style is perfect, it’s simple, kinda loud in a fun way, medium to fast paced, funny, just the right amount of customization options, no overglossing..the game never feels like it breaks character, just all around hasn’t received the credit it deserves at all. If I were to add anything at all to it, it would be more side scrolling and just a longer game (even though for now the farthest I’ve gotten is level 3). This game will be staying on my phone permanently, it’s underpriced, the creators are underpaid, and I’m hopelessly looking forward to merch in the future.\n\nAlso, no, I was not paid to leave this review. I hate writing reviews, I just finally found a truly good game. \n\nNew update crashes, won’t let me play at all ☹️",

It keeps me coming back with the unlocks and characters, and gets my blood pumping with gems as I fly through the increasingly difficult levels. You really care about how much health you have and upgrades will truly help you stay alive in this action packed adventure. Starting above the well on the surface really tops things off. \n\nThe one thing I would like to see change is iPhone X full screen support. It would let the player see much more of the screen with less finger in the way. To be honest if you never changed it I would still play everyday. It would be nice though!\n\nFantastic game 5/5\n\n*UPDATED REVIEW BELOW*\n\nWow, this game hasn’t left my phone since I downloaded it. And that’s saying a lot because I get bored of games really quickly. You would think there’s not much to do, but that’s the beauty of it; you are perfecting the art of falling in a way that hasn’t been done before! \nReaction time, patience, and a few minutes are the ingredients for a good time in Downwell. But there’s nothing stopping you from playing it like a slow paced Mario level! \nWith the characters, upgrades, shop items, and pallete options, this game can be played in countless ways! Amazing!!!!!!\n\nOh and the only thing I would have added has been added just recently! iPhone X support!",

After years of playing I finally made it to the last boss. Not because it’s too hard, it’s not, it’s fair with its snappy and crisp, ultra responsive controls that make every mistake your fault and your fault alone. I’ve never play an iOS game that performed better and had 0 input lag like Downwell does. It’s genuinely designed to keep you playing and coming back to enjoy another round and attempt to find out what is at the bottom of the well, if anything at all. The upgrades don’t carry with you at death, you amass them every time you reach a new level/depth each run through. The color palette swap was a HUGE part in keeping me playing and engaged as the more colors you unlock, the more complex and varied the next one becomes. besides the incredible gameplay of course lol It rewards you for playing and doesn’t lock anything away behind progression that could hinder you in jumping down the well for the first time and beating the game. But I promise, you won’t. Seriously, you won’t lol it’s hard. But hard in an incredible way, not artificial to pad length. Only thing locked is visual perks that change the aesthetic and also different play styles. which can change gameplay dramatically if you want a new way to play or challenge to unravel. And the gunboots. I could talk about them forever. So many different kinds. Although my only advice or WANT would be for the devs to include a DLC pack of MORE gun variations in the future. The game is perfect the way it is but as an option to enhance and switch up a game I’ve played and sunk prolly 500-700 hours into over the years, I’d love MORE GUN MODS. I’d pay double maybe triple what i payed for the game originally for the option to load the game with even more crazy guns to find when descending down the well. It would give a boost of content and happiness to an already incredible game, and base of players that have been itching for an update to a game that they love so much. I even love the game so deeply it has become the only game I’ve ever bought cross-platform other than Stardew Valley and even ended up enjoying the game even more on my Switch. This is a mobile game at heart and it’s a mobile game that is worth $15-$20, hands down, it’s that good. I’ve never seen it priced above $3 dollars ever. I really think it’s one of the most underrated and under appreciated games of all time. And just one of the best games of all time for that matter. Stylized with incredible use of retro graphics with modern effects that give it a gorgeous look and feel, and controls so responsive I couldn’t believe that I had never noticed another game that matched its precision. I love this game, truly I do. I hope someone that’s on the fence on wether they wanna spend a couple bucks on a game on their iPhone reads this and is persuaded because it’s MORE than worth it for the price they’re asking. They’re Essentially giving it away for free if you ask me. I want Downwell to get more praise and more attention and more downloads for the fun it’s extended to me. It and it’s developers deserve so much more praise; it’s a simple concept flipped on its boots and man does it really pull off what a game is supposed to be at its core, fun. Extremely fun.",

The team behind this game definitely knows how to take an interesting concept, and do so much right with it. The gunboots, for example, are something you would never think would exist in anything, but they’re applied so well that you just forget about it. The controls work great on mobile, and I rarely go in a direction I don’t intend. All the explosions feel impactful, and it’s just great to sink a little bit into each play session whenever I want to play. It’s tough, but once you beat it, you’ll feel accomplished. You’ll never have the same experience every game, and it mixes up the game all the time. I’d recommend this game to everyone, and it’s definitely worth the $3 it is.\n\n(This isn’t a paid review, I just love this game).",

If the developers manage to read this and update/fix the problem than this game is a hard 5 and would also change my rating. (As a side note it would also be a REALLY good change if the game would allow the user to change the size of the buttons, as I find it really off putting having to reach all the way to the other side of the screen just to turn right).",

So you have to restart from the first level which is frustrating.\n- When you have headphones on and open the game, sometimes the game will overtake your music app and pause it. No thank you.",
