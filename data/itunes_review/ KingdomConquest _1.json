                    "label": "Update(original review follows): This game is fatally flawed by it’s purchase structure. I am not a person that spends thousands of dollars on in game purchases (I spend some, just not thousands). I don’t expect to be able to compete with people that do, and in most games I don’t have to. In this game, however, the whales and the minnows are all thrown into the tank together. As a result, on my server, a handful of players who had spent well over $10k apiece (possibly much more) had banded together to make it impossible for anyone less spendy to progress. No amount of grinding or cleverness can make a non whale even somewhat competitive, against that much cash—the only choice was whether to be a bootlicker or victim. As a result, the server atmosphere was constantly stressful and angry.\n\nPeople should spend whatever they like on games, If someone wants to dump thousands into a game, that’s fine, but a better game provides a structure that allows players at different levels a way to have fun and grow at their own scale.   Noobs compete with noobs, and whales with other whales. This game does not. The big spenders are untouchable, and the lower or non-spenders have nowhere else to go. The only way to avoid being constantly stomped upon is to pay for perpetual shields. Lose focus for a moment when a whale is watching, you are stomped, your resources and army are gone and you basically are in a coma for a week or two, during which, if you allow shields to waver, you get to start over. Hiding under a shield 24/7 and sneaking out to gather crumbs too small to interest a whale, is not much fun, for me.\n\nAs a simulation of the unhappiness and frustration of a world overrun by fanatical bands of homicidal social darwinists, the game  deserves 5 stars. As a way to have fun with a gaming budget less than the price of a small car, the game is a failure. The game is pretty entertaining up until the point where you are big enough to be tasty whale food, and then starts circling the drain. The game has elements that are really very good, but the flaws more than cancel them out.\n\noriginal review:\n I like this game because actions have consequences. If you pvp, you affect the other player, if you get attacked, your forces resources and infrastructure are reduced. Also, teamwork is essential. Many games have alliances or builds, or whatever but mostly players are playing what is essentially a solo game in parallel with your team mates. This game requires team work and attention to detail.\n\nThe Warhammer fluff is Ok, but not that much of an issue.",

My only problem is how much money they want to make, and how they go about it. The prices charged through pretty much every app on ios, and I'm sure android, can be absolutely insane. Often prices are absolutely poposturous. Mind blowingly almost comically expensive. Compensation for anything is often times laughable, whether it be ads, time invested, etc. Premium in game currencies are always priced more than 10 times what they should be, more expensive than gold and it's not even real. They don't even have the decency to reimburse missing rewards when all it requires is a click of a button on their part. Insanity. Cheap little phone games that are supposed to be/advertised as free, and they cost more than AAA console games to be anything close to competitive and tolerable. It's a shame. Entire industry has become like that. So much greed by developers it's sickening.",

I appreciate the response by the developer to my review and it’s a fun game. Very competitive and if this suits your play style, then this is one of the better ones out there. I would recommend getting with a high ranking alliance though. Once the hierarchy begins, anything less than a top 5 alliance will become fodder for those in the upper ranks. So be aware of that...\n\nDecent game and graphics. However the game is having serious stability issues at least with me on my phone. I have a iPhone 7+ with most current update. However, the game will not stay up for long and crashes back to the home screen. \n\nOtherwise seems to be fun game overall.",

I don’t really have an issue with the PTW that some have. That being said, I cannot give it 5 stars because my enjoyment has been hampered by a pretty nasty tactic. There is a group that teleports their city next to ours and just devastates is and teleports out. I log in to find I was attacked, I have no idea how strong my enemy is, I cannot attack back and I cannot find them on the map. It seems to me this kind of tactic isn’t what the devs were aiming for and is borderline harassment since it goes against fair play. I would have made the teleport usages have a cool down so groups could have fun with attack retaliation and the strategy involved.",

Over the period of the last month or two there have been back to back to back issues and bugs which resulted in many efforts, time, money, energy, etc just being wasted. The awnsers which we get from the developers is “We are sorry, here is our compensation - 1k gems (which in this game is equal to litteraly just 1 teleport, in short the compensation is not worth anything). On big events which require all players from an Alliances coordinatig with their members across several time zones, sacrificing real life time, delaying chores and what not, spending alot of\nmoney (Packs and timers in this game are huge and expensive) all so that when the event starts, the event is bugged, all efforts are flushed down the drain, and in the end we just get a “Sorry here is a banana to compensate your trouble”. Normally this wouldnt be a problem if this was a rare occasion but the problems are happening more and more frequently. As of now theres atleast 2x major problems each week. Considering ALOT of money has been thrown into this game due to building taking from 120-400 days to upgrade at higher levels unless you buy 99$ packs to get it done faster (1x 99$ pack gets u cca 60 days of reduced upgrade time). What have they done with all this money and trust thrown in the game? NOTHING! The game itself feels now like a crazy train going downhill and everything the develepors do seems like they are trying to milk out as much money as possible before the game dies as it stands now. I have only one thing to say to the developers, they should be ashamed of themselves blaming the pandemic for the issues and not working in the office. We are ALL affected by the pandemic, and even if we know there will probably be an economic crissis we spent huge money on the game just to get an excuse which is shamefull!",

It’s got similar issues with all the games in the genre but im not here to outline pros/cons and get into a geeky review mode.\n\nAs of 3 days ago, ive encountered a game breaking mechanic.  I was attacked and annihilated while under the effect of a shield (can throw on shields to prevent pvp incursions in this game).  I was dumbfounded when this took place.  I took screenshots and reached out to the person who attacked me to see whether he/she/they were hacking or something, and the response was even more disturbing. \n\nApparently this was a known issue and that when players shield they may not always “shield” in reality and can be attacked by others.\n\nI immediately contacted the development team to ask for a recourse for millions of resources lost including millions to heal my troops which probably sent me back at least 4 months of my casual play activities.  This was 3 days ago and i have not received a single response as of typing of this review.\n\nTo me this fundamentally shows the importance this company puts on their customer base and this level of borked game play and mechanics should only be expected at a pre-alpha game testing stage, and not for a game in service for over a year.\n\nTruly disappointing and incredible let down.  \n\nUntil they get their act together, id highly recommend moving on to another game.

It’s Warhammer what’s not to love. Some suggestions I have is to keep constantly updating the game, add more units as well, one of the downside I had to this was a lack of units, it’s not like their is barely any units, but more units will make this game more fun, and keep people interested, also the other thing that I suggest, that a lot of people have been suggesting is show the battle, like so we can see what’s going on and so we can command the troops, I know that’s a lot to ask but it would make the game way more different than most strategy games like this, it will be like a mini Total War: Warhammer, So far I’m liking it, and these are my suggestions. Thank you for this great game!",
