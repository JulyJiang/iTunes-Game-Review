                    "label": "This game is magnificent. It is a turn-based RPG that combines two of my favorite things- the Wild West and the Millennium Falcon. \n\nMany moons ago, I downloaded a free demo of the original star traders RPG. It was an unassuming game with very simple graphics, and I enjoyed it enough that I downloaded it again each time I got a new phone for over a decade. Recently I upgraded my phone again, and discovered the long-awaited sequel (which, after a decade, I had written off) to the old indie game I loved. It is everything I hoped for and more.\n\nAll the elements I loved from the old game are on steroids- the hokey charm, the feeling of desperation as I hold my ship together, zipping around the galaxy looking for work that isn’t TOO unsavory, staying one step ahead of the authorities and a few centimeters from a frozen death in the void of space.\n\nLet me tell you about permadeath. On the higher difficulties, there is only one save file, and when your captain dies that file is deleted. Permanently. That mechanic makes this game feel absolutely real. You will get more invested in your captain and your crew than you ever did for Master Chief or Laura Croft, and when one of your people dies, they die forever. It’s sad. Legit. \n\nYou could turn permadeath off, but IMO you would be doing yourself a disservice, because that pulls you into the immersive experience. Each of your crew had personality traits that affect their stats and their gameplay. Often it’s very minor, and it seldom feels burdensome, but I have had to fire experienced crewmen because they got addicted and mean- one too many weeks in the void. Some traits can be fixed by doctors- it is the future, after all- but that’s pricy, doctors that do it aren’t everywhere, and there isn’t always enough coin to do what you want. Sometimes you will have to make hard choices.\n\nOne last thing that I appreciate is that this is turn based and solo. If I’m on airplane mode, that’s fine. If I have to put my phone down because something comes up, no big deal. There is no penalty for having a life and not saving because it effectively saves every time you give an order.",

It runs very well, and I have never experienced glitches or crashes.  The art is also really cool.  The stories are well designed.  They don’t feel hokey or childish but rather embrace a complex system of alliances and enemies that make each play through potentially different.  I like being able to choose gender of your character, as I am a woman and I get tired of being forced to play male characters.\nCons: this is a very slow grind, and after awhile the turn based combat, whether between ships or crews, gets old.  This is not so for everyone and many will not mind this.  \nSpace travel also becomes repetitive and as you progress through each mission requires multiple jumps and often visits to planets to refuel on the way.  This just got boring to me after a while.  \nAn auto save feature and a way to shortcut through travel, combat etc if you want would really help open this game to a more casual audience.  I couldn’t even begin to scratch the surface of this game until quarantine cleared my calendar. Just starting out is so difficult.   This is not a universe one can fully explore right away. You can easily find yourself in a rabbit hole where you have no money, no fuel, no chops in combat and your ship is teeming with mutiny.  I had to restart 5 or 6 times.  The learning curve is steep and death comes easy if you venture to an area above your skill level.  I finally started with the option that gives you a good ship and that helped me get going.  \nI hope this honest review helps people decide.  This is a game some will love, but I think I will be uninstalling soon.",

I would give this 5* if it was a free game; since it has kind of a high price tag I think it could use a few improvements:\n1) still no retirement button for captains that have been out there awhile?  I saw a few threads online from a couple of years back mentioning this, and so far I haven’t come across an end-of-career option so what gives?\n2) when I’m flying my Sword Battlecruiser around, why am I still attacked by spies, bounty hunters, zealots and the like flying ships that I can just chew up, spit out and be on my way?  I know there are components I can add to my ship to reduce random encounters, but why would these insects be attacking something that can so obviously stomp them?  Even if they’re extremely hostile, they should just be hurling strong language at me from afar.\n3) could definitely use an art upgrade.  I’m not expecting cutting-edge graphics but the character art is just a bad joke.\n\nAnyway, still enjoying the game, and I *do* think it’s worth the price, especially given that it’s still being actively developed.  Just would like to see these 3 things improved :)",

In ship combat for example when selecting a flight plan for craft  it’s impossible to scroll through the list of flight plans and the ones at the top are half cut off.\n\nThe same issue occurs when recruiting crew, where half of the window is cut off and it’s impossible to scroll up to view more options.\n\nThe game itself deserves five stars, and I’ll update this review if they ever fix the UI problems.",

One feature which would be awesome is to customize your starting officers, either by attributes or jobs (ie: why does my ENG, who won’t be in combat, have a 30 quickness and is Ex-Military, but my Doc who is going to be a Combat Medic, has an 18 quickness and has the Wanderlust trait. I’d love to just swap their starting jobs). When I wanted to play a combat focused captain, I ended up scrapping and ‘rerolling’ 20+ times until I had a starting officer trio I felt could take on the jyeeta by endgame. Even a title screen which says “here are your 3-4 starting officers, pick whom you would like to be the ENG, Doc, and QM, would be awesome!\n\nJust some feedback; love the game",

You get too much too soon with little explanation about what’s going on. The learning curve is just overwhelmingly brutal. I’m 36 and have been playing video games since I could pick up a controller. This mess of a game just seems half finished. Half the game is just making sure you have enough fuel to get around. The UI is messy and jumbled, ship and crew combat is atrocious and boring. I love turn based games but this? Nah.\n\nThey really need to rework the beginning of the game to ease the player into everything instead of throwing you into it. The way it is now it feels like you skipped the first quarter of the game.\n\nIt’s too late for me to get a refund so just be warned. This is not an easy game to play. Heck it’s not even a hard game to play. It’s a brutal game to play and not in a fun or challenging way.",

My Interdictors still don’t interdict (lol) missiles, torpedoes, nor do they engage in any way with incoming craft. And it’s actually a tiiiiiny but sucky, just for someone who has been AWE’ED(whaaa?) by the carrier-based play available.

And some day, some fateful day where you didn’t even realize that the last thing you(r captain) would ever eat was an English muffin, with melted butter, and whatever strawberry jam or jellylike substance that’s still made with the real fruit. \n\nThen, your captain dies. \n\nYou failed your save. “What save you ask?” Welcome to the Void, Traveler. \n\nMy second caveat is actually null and voided with the very latest update. And believe me, I have let my life suffer for this game (short term, all short term, and thanks to no game mechanics-abusing IAPs there were NO financial setbacks from playing this game too much!)\n\nI’m googling the Trese Brothers rn, and see if they have a Patreon or something I can bequeath a few of my actually literally precious few dollars these days to their work.

But a few issues make it tedious: the fact that there is no true “save” is one of the most catastrophic developer choices I’ve ever seen. Due to bugs in engagement balancing, you can occasionally get rolled by another ship or crew.  And the result? Perma-death or massive loss. This takes the fun out of the game. You can spend days building up a ship and crew only to see them destroyed due to a bug and no means of restoring it. Also, the crew fighting (land) engagements are well below the quality of the rest of the game and feel like early 90’s gaming mechanics.",

But it's not perfect, which sometimes leads to some frustration.  I'll cover these below:\n\nPros:  The ability to customize evetything!  Your Captain, crew, ship, equipment.\nThe totally open nature of play; you don't have to do ANY of the story missions.\nAbsorbing main story lines.\nGreat ship and crew combat; stylized and simple in mechanics, but detailed in options and customizable to suit your style.\nThe talent system and faction rank/permit system that allows you to avoid most hostile encounters as time goes on (see below).\nDeveloper support; updates, great online boards with developer presence!\n\nCons:  The card games!  These are ridiculously biased towards bad events, and talents for replacing/removing cards don't increase the probability of mission success, they only remove or alter a negative.  This is a major frustration since EVERYTHING requires the card game.\nThe random encounters actually seem to increase as the game progresses, making it more and more difficult to perform routine tasks like flying around.  This frustration is mitigated by the talents you get and your faction rank/permits, so isn't as much a frustration as the card game (though a xeno or hostile bounty hunter can still ruin yor day!).",

Was working for someone, had two missions I was working on, when all of a sudden when I got to my destination the missions had vanished. I went back but the contact had also disappeared. Is that supposed to happen? Why did she disappear? Also for some reason have had a couple mutinies without cause. Like high moral and not short on crew, so if everybody is happy and we are fully staffed then why am I getting mutinies? Wasn’t even after a battle or anything jus random mutiny while traveling. And not sure if glitch or if Im doing it wrong but even if I get the perk and proper permits to capture a prize ship it dosent let me. Are the prize ships the main battle ships or the small ships launched durring battle? If its the small ones could you add some sort of system where we cab tow a captured main ship back to a port and repair and keep it or sell it for money. It would also be nice if all the dry docks were connected because I had left a ship at one before and wasn’t able to find it again. Maybe at least make a system that tells you where all your owned ships are? Also could you add some sort of help page so I don’t have to go through apple to report glitches? I feel like these aren’t usually read. Anyway aside from those glitches the game is really fun and I have been enjoying playing it.",

And not just to patch bugs or refine mechanics—they keep adding new content like storylines, ships, classes, quests, equipment, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, you’re probably never going to get to use quite a bit of that content, because it’s locked behind achievements and linked to inflated difficulty levels.\n\nSome achievement criteria can be met simply by successfully navigating the storyline (something the game doesn’t necessarily require you to do, btw, which is nice). Others require you to do a “sprint” run, where you put together a captain and crew with a very specific skill set to meet requirements within a limited timeframe (e.g. blockade 50 planets in the first two years of gametime).\n\nNow, so far, none of these elements are gamebreakers, but: 1) RNG plays a huge role in every encounter/interaction in this game, and 2) most of the achievements can only be unlocked with permadeath set to “on.” This combination means that, if you’re trying to unlock the full game you’ve purchased, you’re going to be playing the complete first era or two of the storyline a LOT. Even when things are going well, the RNG gods will often suddenly dump an alien battleship or elite terrorist squad in your lap well before you’ve had a chance to build up your ship/characters to the point where they have even a slim chance of survival.\n\nAnd that’s where permadeath pushes the game over the edge from ‘challenging’ to ‘downright frustrating.’ A single bad dice roll can easily cause a cascade failure where the in-game equivalent of stubbing your toe snowballs into a complete slaughter of your entire crew within just a couple rounds of action, and then it’s back to the character creation screen. The first time it happens, it’s hilarious. The 147th time it happens, you start thinking that getting your taxes done early might be a fun alternative way to spend your time.\n\nOf course, you can turn permadeath off, and as long as you’re okay with leaving numerous ships and starting contacts/professions unavailable for play that’s a viable option. If you want to use everything you purchased, however, you’re going to be required to play the first few missions dozens and dozens and DOZENS of times.  The game is good enough that you might still come back to it after taking a break from it for a month or two; at some point, you WILL have to choose between either taking a break from it or throwing your phone/tablet through a window in frustration.",
