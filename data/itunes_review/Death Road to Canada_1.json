Now the title (in accordance with their announced pricing model) has gone up to $12 and . . . I am happy to pay it! These are great devs who have continued to provide exemplary post-release support (think Steam-level post-release support) for this title and others (eg, Wayward Souls from 2014 has a sizable update in the pipeline per the devs). As for DRtC, I see elements of many titles, the most salient of which are Oregon Trail (which I played a couple of times in the ‘80s on what may have been a Tandy 1000) and FTL: Faster Than Light. Wit and humor abound in this wild romp for the northern border. Thanks, Rocketcat, for another AAA iOS experience and for elevating the platform.",

This Masterpiece of comedy, dispair, and gory awesomeness will most certainly keep you playing for a long time. Plus the best part is, it’s literally infinitely playable, when you start up this game the music blasts your ears in rock / techno music, then you notice the character creator with the over 50 perks / traits, I won’t spoil the rest of this awesomeness of an indie game.\n  Now to a different subject, the controls in this game are terrible. So if you have a controller to connect to your iPad, you have been saved from being ripped off (LOL). \n  The gameplay... Shockingly amazing, absolutely brilliant is this gameplay. Bountiful with content, pets, so many weapons, being able to move / pickup (depending on your perk) / throw every piece of furniture and car (yes) there is in the game right now (soon the KIDNEY update will be out soon, so get excited). Playing this game will become your priority for a vary long time, due to only some of the things I have said in this review.\n  So are you ready to go get it? If not let me tell you a few more things since I am only showing you the top of the treasure that is this game. If you want, I’ll relate this game to Sheltered because... well... I can. Think of Sheltered with zombies, with so much gameplay it’s stupid to even fathom. \n  I hope you read this review and are currently pressing that satisfying purchase button, cause you are going to love this game. \n\nRecap: Tons of replay probability, awesome gameplay, fun comedy , Gore that isn’t unsettling, awesome developer, and loads of character customization (seriously the most you probably ever seen).                                                                 Enjoy a Masterpiece.\n\n  Also, I’m waiting for ign to rate this game... seriously (LOL).",

I was skeptical 2 years back at the price tag but took the leap of faith and it was the best purchase I have made on my phone. I easily have over 500 plus hours invested in this game and am currently tackling endless mode to earn my ranks with the elite. Unfortunately ran into a bug on day 300 or somewhere close to that day and trading camps and npcs will no longer spawn leaving me unable to continue my play through. I’m still rating 5 stars since this has been my only game breaking bug and it’s on a mode that not many people even attempt to do so it probably hasn’t received much attention. But devs please post a possible solution for this so I may still have a chance to continue on my current endless run.",

This game is sooo fun and would recommend it. The only problem is that in my opinion is that it’s a little pricy. I would say $10 max. This game is still worth it and recommend this to other people who like adventure story games",

Once you do that it has the best controls of any mobile game I’ve ever played. This game is very difficult however. I put 30 hours in it before I got my first win. Once you master the controls you become a zombie killing machine. This game is excellent for those moments in life where you need a 25-105 minute break from work, Spanish class, or whatever. I often finish all my classwork approximately halfway before class ends and this is what I do after. I am honestly shocked that such a witty and well developed game is able to be run so effectively on a mobile device. This is a game with infinite replay value. I’m still finding locations and characters that I have not seen, and they are always adding more! It is very rarely that I feel that my all-to-frequent deaths were the games fault. This is very often a frustrating game but winning it is exceptionally satisfying. And after you get to Canada you unlock quite a few more game modes. This is the pinochle of mobile games. All a person’s phone needs is Death Road to Canada, BTD6, and PUBG Mobile. With those games you have entertainment for any situation. If you even think you’ll enjoy it, buy it. It’s worth much more than they sell it for. Mobile is the perfect platform for this game. You always have your phone so you always have this masterpiece.",

This game is so refined and polished to the point where I can’t believe it’s only 15 bucks! Honestly the replay value of this game with its tons of events, characters, vehicles, weapons, areas, game modes, and hilarious jokes is unmatched by any console game I can think of. It’s hard, and sometimes deaths can be aggravating, but each death lets you learn, okay, next time I won’t try to wrestle a moose! The custom character creator is brilliant with traits and perks of your friends and family give the game a personal touch and some funny scenarios, like how the “Berserk” trait has a character maul 3 bandits to save the group without a thought. The game is just simply a blast to play, from the careful decision making to the crazy stressful sieges. I won’t spill too luck of the gameplay because I want people to experience it for themselves. Put short, this game is a masterpiece, 5 stars without question. And one more thing, the developers listened to my complaint, I won’t say what, because again spoilers, but yeah this company cares about their games!",

When you start the game they put you into a tutorial which shows you the basics of moving, attacking, and looting I guess. But they don’t explain to you what I think is a majority of the game the item management and character optimizations. The tutorial doesn’t show you what different weapon types do, how they interact with certain stats, or even how the guns work. Often times a character would be low health while I had a healing supplies but I didn’t know how to use them. There is a lot if depth to how characters are defined stat and class wise but without an explanation I found it frustrating to die repeatedly because I couldn’t understand what was happening. \n\nAlso I have an issue with how the controls for moving are implemented. It might just be me but because you have an area that you slide ur finger around to move the character, I found myself having to repeatedly move my thumb back to neutral position because it would eventually run out of room on the screen. I like the other static joy stick style controls more because it makes me feel like I have more control.",

But you might have left the chainsaw in the back of the car, you see what I’m saying? This game will constantly try to hit you in the face with a tree, but there’s always that whimsical random encounter or event that’ll be sure to make you laugh. Overall, Death Road To Canada is a game that’s able to balance out cruelty with funny content, and is worth the money. 👌",
