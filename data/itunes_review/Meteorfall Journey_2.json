I couldn’t figure out why; I felt like I made the right choices on what to upgrade and buy and remove and whatnot, but I always seemed to get murdered by a tough area 2 monster. \n\nThen on one run with the wizard I decided not to fight nearly every monster; I rested a lot more, and actually prepared to go into fights, rather than blindly attacking every monster. And with some nice random events and good choices, I breezed by to a victorious run. And it was satisfying. I just mention it because it didn’t seem so obvious to me that you’d still gain enough XP to level up even if you choose to rest on 3 or 4 monsters per area. \n\nIt’s certainly not as brutal as this developer’s previous deck building rogue-like app: Dream Quest. If you’re looking to scratch a deck-building rogue-like itch, this’ll get it done until Slay the Spire comes to mobile. Looking forward to getting victories w all 5 characters.",

                    "label": "Simplistic fun deckbuilding game. I have one complaint: using your gems to “unlock” cards actually adds them to your starting deck. While they’re relatively powerful early, I find that in the long run “unlocking” cards weakens your deck substantially as the strongest strategy in this game is to keep a small, heavily upgraded deck full of synergy cards. The cards that you unlock aren’t bad, but are ultimately more things to upgrade or remove. Mischief especially is hurt by the extra cards, as without them it’s much easier to make a deck that can consistently cycle through itself multiple times a turn. To the developers, I suggest adding a toggle to the cards, and letting players choose whether or not to include them in their starting deck after unlocking them. Also, I’d consider reflecting on the design philosophies surrounding these “upgrades” actually weakening the deck, and consider reworking it to give a more rewarding sense of progression. Overall, I really like this game, and consider it a worthwhile addition to the genre. :)",

With only one card per hand, there is no opportunity for strategy in when/how the cards are played. One can’t make the strategic decision to skip a card to gain stamina to proc an ‘if your stamina is higher’ bonus, which leaves it completely up to luck.  Really is a huge step backwards from Dreamquest.  The developers were too enamored with their flick left/right mechanic to consider whether or not it really worked for the game.  I recommend you check out Dreamquest instead.",

Easy controls (swipe left or right) make it an excellent game to play anywhere! It’s a rogue-like game meaning once you lose you start over, but you don’t feel like you wasted any time. I’ve literally been playing for HOURS! Thanks for this gem of a game! I wish I could donate more towards future development!",

One quip I have though is it seems I always draw shadow pact first while it isn’t charged ending up with me taking extra damage on the cleric and sometimes ending playthrus early. If this intended then could it be stated as such, if not maybe the algorithm could be looked at since it seems like it’s targeting. And no it isn’t because of a fluke once or twice it’s like every time it is uncharged. Regardless of this little gripe this game is amazing and I am hoping for more content like characters, cards bosses and the like. But even where the game stands now totally worth the money. I also could possibly see adding a feature to fine tune a starting deck using gems for either an extra character or something like that, just because I have already amassed a couple thousand even after unlocking everything. Hope there is a long life for this game because it’s great.",

                    "label": "After countless runs and an excess of 5000 unspendable gems, here are some broad thoughts:\n\nThe swiping mechanic (of Tinder fame) and art style do all of the heavy-lifting here. \n\nUnfortunately, the cardpool and dungeon structures are very poorly designed. Worst of all, at every point that the game has the potential to offer interesting or meaningful choices, it doesn’t.\n\nTo elaborate, here is a collection of longer thoughts (in no order):\n\n(1) Why don’t potions scale? Also, an Alchemist/Potion Master hero seems like an obvious and natural inclusion (e.g. playing and skipping ingredients to brew the exact potion the player needs).\n\n(2) The cardpool itself is tiny! To make matters worse, the subset of good cards (among all 4 heroes) is maybe 10. And even then, the design diversity amongst those cards is terribly small.\n\n(3) There are simply too many lazy, similar, underpowered, and/or disconnected cards:\n\n- Hemorrhage and poison (make statuses matter more with high-synergy cards, or diversify their effects).\n- Iron skin vs. plate armor (are you kidding me?).\n\n(4) Due to these large issues with card design, there are essentially no builds. Every Mischief playthrough is the same: pray for Temples to remove all of your bad cards and then Stab-chain into Eviscerate. This follows for the other 3 heroes (e.g. Bruno: Charge + Veteran Strike; Rose: Smite + Heals; Greybeard: Thunderstorm + Zap). Across all of these, it’s just the same mindless pattern of damage bursting; there is zero meaningful or interesting design to engage with!\n\nImagine if the player was given some agency in their starting deck (e.g. starting with a Daggers, Observe, or Shatter) so that there would be an actual incentive to replay the game and experience diverse playstyles.\n\n(5) The quests/events are shockingly bad due to one option being so clearly worse than the other (I’m looking at you “gain 2xp”). They simply don’t serve their intended purpose (i.e. fun or interesting decision-making).\n\n(6) Connected to (4), the starting decks are just awful. It should be telling that Temples are the best event, as they are the only means of selectively removing the terrible and sleep-inducing cards that we’re forced to start with every single run. Why not give the starting decks at least a little variability (e.g. an opening, “Choose Your Own Adventure” series of quests to give more background story on the hero and more player agency in crafting an interesting deck).\n\n(7) Dungeons are absent of design:\n\n- Each dungeon consists of a linear progression through 16 randomly-generated encounters. There are no paths for the player to make meaningful choices.\n- Why is the boss the only unique aspect of a dungeon?! Why doesn’t the boring wooden background change? Why aren’t their unique quests/events, enemy types, or cards for each dungeon?\n\n(8) There are maybe 8 different enemies total? Their decks are more-or-less basic, with zero interactivity or interesting mechanics that require different approaches. \n\n(9) Similarly, there are 7 bosses that are absolute pushovers. Any sliver of difficulty is avoided by the fact that your hero is fully healed upon beating a dungeon (so there is virtually no punishment for facerolling them). \n\nI could go on and on, but I’ll cut it here. At the end of the day, I am impressed with how disappointed I am, because I can clearly see the potential here. I just don’t know if it will ever be executed on. Here’s hoping.",

I will start with the pros and move to the cons. This is a great game that is a lot of fun to play. Having played several deck building games using real cards I really enjoy the gameplay in this. The decks have real synergy and I love the feeling of seeing my deck come to life and play out exactly like I wanted it to. The quirky art style and names really give the game a light hearted and fun feeling. This feeling is further emphasized through its simple swipe left or right Tinder mechanic. I love how easy and simple it is to play this game, it’s become my “bathroom game” if you will. I can play this game for 5 minutes or 45 minutes and get an enjoyable playing experience out of both. \nMy cons are negatives to be sure, but they are not set in stone, they can be remedied with time and updates. The decks are mildly limited in diversity and once you have a deck figured out there is little mystery to the decks after that. Decks provide some room for alteration, but not as much personal customization as I’d like. In the future I’d love to see more characters get added (hopefully not for some paid add-in) so that I can continue to explore what this game can do. Having a “card library” where players can make their own decks would be cool too. This game gives us, as players, the ability to alter Pre-made decks, but not make our own. I’d spend hours in like a practice run session testing and revising my own deck until it fit my own personal play style juuuuuussst right. \nOverall, this is a very fun game with a great dynamic and gameplay. Games like this, in my opinion, define the phone gaming genre: light hearted and quirky fun when you have a minute to devote to a good challenge.",

I really like this art style and the light RPG feel of upgrading cards, treasure, buying cards, etc. it ads a lot of depth. \n\nOne thing i kind of wish the game had was a kind of story mode where you are building a character through multiple play throughs. Kind of like with Infinity Blade. \n\nIn that game your xp, hp, and equipment carry on after each time you die. That way, every time you play you get further and further. \n\nI like the game a lot, but I can never get past the second boss I encounter. Maybe I’m just not very good, but it’s kind of a bummer loosing all that progress. \n\nMaybe there’s a way to do something where you die, then replay, and when you catch up to where you were you find that characters items or something. Could be fun. \n\nI do love the game otherwise. Great job.",

Then there’s the audio that just feels there to exist. Filler noise. \n\nWhat I hope to see: more content! I want to see enemies specific to zones (ie. undead in crypts, insects and scavengers and bandits in the desert, etc). I want more zone variety. More characters and character specific cards. Some audio for the characters when they take damage or die could be cool. Maybe daily challenges. \n\nI know this game recently came out but I have high hopes!!! <3",

It's not enough to dethrone Dream Quest as my favorite immobile game, but it's still a refreshing change from the IAP-filled cashgrabs flooding the App Store.\n\nI only have a few minor complaints. It's a little too easy to win with most classes (Rose was the trickiest for me), and it would be nice to see more cards and classes. The final boss especially seems too easy. Also, hackers have ruined the scoreboard. It'd be nice for that to be cleaned up.\n\nAnyway, it's definitely worth your time and a few bucks. Hopefully the game sees some more expansion in the future.",
