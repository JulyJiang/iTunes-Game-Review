I have another game that I play everyday and have done so for a year....haven't played that game since I picked this one up. I can't seem to put this down . I have figured a lot out rather  quickly. It shocked me I guess I hit the right keyword. Threw me off guard though I wasn't prepared for it lol. Great game however I already know I won't get the complete story with this one....I'll have to wait for pt 2 I'm sure...and I want to know 🤔...her story",

I liked seeing the story in bits and pieces. It wasn't overly confusing, and it did add a slightly creepy air at certain points.\n\nHowever, once the chat screen popped up (perhaps because I'm on a phone?), the video interface moved to the side to expose another clickable (the purpose of which I'm not exactly sure), cutting off my access to the fifth video in a search. So I'm pretty sure that I'm not able to see everything there is to see. \n\nI do still have quite a few questions, and maybe that's a feature of the game, but I think it's more likely that I just can't access all the videos due to telling the little chat guy that I'd figured it out. So don't end it until you are sure you've seen everything.\n\nAll in all, creative and engaging, but four stars for not being able to go back and re-watch everything.",

I can't stop thinking about it. \n\nI'd love to see more games in this format!",

The acting is subpar, at best. Of course with Leo Dicap winning a GG for his miscast performance in the travesty that is \"The Revenant\", I am not sure most people will even see how blatantly thespian (and thus bland, since we ain't watching a play) her acting is... It's moot though, cause if this were $.99 then I'd say, buy it, but at the price it's been at, trust me, you may as well find some fulfillment figuring out some answer or getting some concrete sign of progress in an equally interesting game that does not purport to be unique and not feel shafted out of the small fortune which is the cost of Her Story.
