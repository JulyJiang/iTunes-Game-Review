The second time I played, I did it over the course of a weekend in an attempt to start Banner Saga 2 right after.  Seeing that Banner Saga 2 was just as challenging, if not more challenging, than the first game, I put it down.  I just picked up Banner Saga 1 and played through it a third time, so that I could maintain story cohesion for Banner Saga 2.  I'm glad I did!!  Banner Saga 2 was very epic in a lot of new ways, while maintaining all of the really cool features of the first: nail-biting strategy RPG battles, nail-biting Oregon Trail choice making, a KILLER musical score, and beautiful art. I will probably play Banner Saga 2 a second time in anticipation of playing the third.  Thank you for this beautiful RPG, very exciting and memorable! update: 11/19/20 I played BS2... two more times! I also bought BS1 and BS2 for PS4 and Switch. will there ever be an iOS port of BS3?",

However I played it about 4 years ago, and clearly some things have changed in BS2, notably around save and load mechanics.\n\nFirst, I get to a battle which is utterly unwinnable.  Not “hard” but “impossible”. This is bad enough.  (some woman we picked up who then ambushes you in the snow. You have no choice of characters. it assigns 3 rubbish level 1 characters to your party who are always eliminated on turn 1, no turn order, and the tactical situation is impossible. \n\nI consider myself pretty good - I have never lost a battle, never had to jump out, and I play on hard mode; but his battle is a joke. \n\n7 times I failed, so I decided to back up and load a previous save. Since you can’t control the saves, the “most recent” was several hours of play time back as I found when I opened the save. Seeing this I decided to abandon this course, and simply accept a defeat and move on.I went to load my “previous” save (the point before the terrible battle) only to find this no longer existed and the latest save was moments after the older one — thus losing me hours of real time and results of several battles.\n\nBottom line : unwinnable battles pretty poor, inability to “save” is a deal breaker. Don’t start this game unless you like to be frustrated.\n\nOh, and final nail : BS 3 won’t come out on iOS  so it is a bit like a tv programme you enjoy that has had its last season cancelled on a cliff hanger. Don’t make the investment.\n\nIf there was a “save” button",

I really enjoyed the different ways you can develop your characters, the different strategic requirements of the battles, and most of all, the really engaging story. It isn’t often that you see a game where the decisions really matter and you have so much freedom to find your way through a story. \n\nHOWEVER, the studio (Stoic) has not ported Banner Saga 3 to mobile, and appears uninterested in doing so, which means that I’m not able to finish the story I invested so many hours in. I’m very disappointed in the studio. This game, along with its predecessor, are the first video games to get my attention in a long, long time, and its really upsetting that Stoic seems to not realize or not care that there are people who play these games on their mobile devices and are unable to play them otherwise. Hopefully they will come around to porting #3 sooner or later, but until then, I can’t recommend getting invested in this or the first installment. Two stars because it’s such a fantastic game, but ultimately, a real letdown.",

The story is like a book you can’t put down, the choices incredibly well thought out, rarely black and white with characters drawn so vividly caring about the outcome is all but compulsory.  The gameplay is satisfying with balanced mechanics and  at first glance  simple yet fun turn based combat easy to grasp while  masking a  much deeper strategic and tactical system underneath allowing clever use of synergies, positioning, unique class abilities and more, giving you plenty to dig into and master.\n\nIt builds and improves on its predecessor, fine tuning  gameplay, adding classes and including additional features like destructible physical barricades and an addition I particularly enjoyed- optional training combat scenarios that teach how new abilities work and can best be utilized while rewarding the ever  needed resource termed “renown”.  Speaking of which the resource system is simple, but brilliant. Do you spend renown on supplies to keep your people from starving and dying, spend it to level up your heroes or purchasing gear/items.  And managing that balance of resource is crucial.\n\nI can’t recommend this Saga enough and have pestered, cajoled, pressured  friend after friend to get it/play it and not one has been disappointed.  Writing a review for a game I enjoy is quite rare; but a game like this- I had too.  Don’t think I’ve written a review since divinity2 or witcher3.  \n\nThe only real complaint is wanting more!!! More story more game more everything and luckily I still have the concluding entry of the trilogy to look forward to, banner saga 3.\n\nTo anyone reading and considering. You are in for a treat.  And if you have the option play on iPad over iPhone.  The extra screen size is ideal.",

                    "label": "The artwork and music in this game are breathtaking, as has been notes in many other places. I love many things about the gameplay, such as the well designed and creative abilities and synergies between the heroes. I played through the Mac version of the first game on the computer and I’m halfway through the second on mobile.\n\nThe reason for 4/5 is I keep finding myself wanting certains small changes for conveying information during combat (that wouldn’t change gameplay at all, but make it easier / more convenient to get all the information about what is happening).\nSpecifically: 1) I mostly use the show all armor / strength display in the top right to get an overview of strong enemies still left on the field. It would be a really helpful thing to do something like add a red outline around the displayed armor / str of enemies to more easily sort through the information at a glance, when there are many units clumped together; currently the display is the same for your own units and enemies, making it quite confusing in the case of many units bunched together. This feels like such an obvious small touch that I’m surprised it’s missing given the attention to small details through the whole game as a whole. \n2) The biggest lack I feel is the ability to quickly ascertain enemy turn order. In order to figure out the enemy’s turn order you have to click through each portrait, see where they are on the board, then use the clunky armor / str display to see how much damage the enemies can do etc. If there are more enemies than fit in the queue, tough luck. The game mechanics of this game are very similar to Into the Breach (the biggest difference being the fact that each side gets a turn with all their units in that other game) and I would love to have a button like Into the Breach does for a quick overview of enemy turn orders: when you press it, it shows numbers next to each enemy unit, 1 for the next enemy unit in the queue, 2 for the one after etc\n\nAnyway, great job with the game! Even though I mostly focused on what I wish the game implemented, it’s still a work of art and wonderful design. It’s effective at creating a real atmosphere, and the ending of the first game made me cry :*) Perhaps someone has made mods to the pc version with my desired features, Imay have to look into that :)",

But the writing took a big step backward in the sequel. I was mostly satisfied with the content of the story, but the style of the writing was sometimes flippant, cheesy and generally much less mature than the first one. I’ll be purchasing the third as soon as it is released on iOS because I do feel attached to seeing how the story ends. But I hope the quality is back to the standards of the first one.",

I had such a difficult time with it, I had to put the game away for a month before I wanted to try again. And the ending was a little less satisfying than last time.

It adds new character and gameplay that keep the game fresh and fun. \n\nI was originally disappointed that I missed the Picking up BS2 when it was on sale for 4.99. But even though I paid full price for the game ($9.99) it is still worth every penny. \n\nIf you have played this game on a different platform I’m sure it’s a Great experience. But if you want the best gameplay experience IOS is the way to go. \n\nI cannot wait to see how Stoic wraps up this epic saga.",
