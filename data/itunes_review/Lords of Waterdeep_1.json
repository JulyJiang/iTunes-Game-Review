This was seriously my favorite mobile game but it is UNPLAYABLE in landscape. It’s a MOBILE game and I play it on the go. If I am sitting down and can play with two hands then I’m certainly not gaming on my phone. Nonsensical. \n\nI haven’t played in a few years and downloaded the game. The lack of portrait mode breaks this for me. This was the perfect game to play on the train or while walking, but landscape makes that impossible. Can we at least have a toggle? I think I’ll delete and check in a year to see if it’s fixed.",

I play this game on an iPhone and have no problems reading the cards and spaces.  If the card appears small, touch it and it will enlarge so you can read it.  Touch it again to return it to the board.\n\nI would recommend turning down the animations if you play it a lot, FYI, otherwise the game can be a battery killer though.\n\nThis is a fun, engaging game with just enough strategy to be fun but not so much that you can’t multitask.  You can play a game in 30 minutes which for me is perfect.\n\nIf you enjoy board games, light strategy and/or fantasy settings, I would recommend giving it a try.  Start with the basic game with two other players (if you play with one generated player, you will be relentlessly attacked so play with two).  The Undermountain expansion adds a lot to the game without creating complexity, so I always play with it and I also recommend the extended play.  \n\nThe Skullport expansion is confusing in the app.  I don’t play it.  I don’t find it to be user friendly.  But I never liked it all that much to begin with.\n\nHope this review helps!",

Multiplayer works well.  The little touches such as the animations of birds flying overhead and ships coming in and out of port, as well as the thematic sounds effects just go to show what talented developers can do in digital to bring an analog game to life.  Playdek rarely disappoints and they live up to their reputation in this adaptation.  I have no complaints and highly recommend this app.",

But rather than just eject my player from the game, the AI takes over my game. I can’t play with my friends anymore; I can’t watch their game finish up; and they still wanted me playing with them. \n\nWhy not include a way for the other players to choose to boot a player who has run out of time (like Board Game Arena), rather than forcing them out? That’s just dumb. Some of us like to take our time when we play. \n\nAnd it looks like they haven’t updated the fame for years, so it’s unlikely that anything useful is going to happen on this front.

I also learned to play the game by doing tutorials.  Game seems really strategic, lots of possibilities, skill seems to matter a lot, and the opponent can really throw a monkey wrench into your plan.  This game is pretty awesome!  I’d suggest to devs that they allow old players a toggle to switch back to portrait UI and cards visible (I might try it out myself), but the game seems perfectly playable with this UI.\nSidenote:  I had similar experience with Pathfinder — early player, loved it, was hammering on Quest Mode & loving it — and then dev’s removed Quest Mode & the players rebelled, essentially killing the ratings & loyalty of the players.  While I think this is also still a great game using D&D IP, I don’t understand why dev’s would intentionally alienate their loyal players just to push gamers to do more IAPs (which they won’t bc of the hate).

I’ve read about the UI being messy, and so forth, which initially caused me to hesitate in purchasing the game. However, after I did purchase it, I found the UI to be fine (not great). \n\nNothing in this game will blow you away; however, as with the board game, the mechanics are simple and some complex strategy. Said mechanics can get more complex with purchase of expansions (I did not do this), which can radically change the game.\n\nOnline play is essentially nonexistent.\n\nOverall? If you like the board game or, to a lesser extent, worker placement games, you’ll enjoy this. Be aware that you likely won’t be playing online.",

Playing the Unexpected Success card (draw two cards and play them instantly) only allows you to play the second. The first card goes in your hand.\n\n3. On the results screen, the wrong lord picture is sometimes displayed.\n\nHaving the quest list/intrigue card hand display cover part of the map is annoying. Also it’s really easy to miss the play a quest phase, due to inconsistencies with the confirm action button.",

Each turn, you're trying to complete quests by accumulating units of various professions (and also money). Each player has a secret agenda, which changes what types of questions you'll prefer. There's considerable variety in how each game plays out, and the sounds and graphics add nicely to play. This isn't a D&D RPG. But it's very enjoyable. It's nice to have a game where you turn your mind on rather than off, on iOS.\n\nEdit: Minus one star for the update the switched to landscape. This took a 5-star game and worsened playability. In a strange way, it’s a little prettier. But I have a much harder time playing. They had (and no doubt in their codebase still HAVE) and perfectly good portrait-orientation UI. If they wanted to enable landscape, I wish they’d done it by giving is the OPTION which one to use. As I type this, the average rating is now 2.6. When I first reviewed it as a 5-star game, its average was quite a bit higher.",
