The game is fun - but overpriced in terms of hours of gaming enjoyment if they never deliver on the \"more modules are coming\" promise.   I have to agree w/ another reviewer - if you’re reading these reviews, wondering if you should purchase... the answer is NO!! It’s not worth it unless they extend the game.",

                    "label": "I was enthusiastic about Galactic Keep after I read the reviews, saw a video that mentioned it, and saw the screenshots. After buying and downloading the game, and playing through several levels, I feel like it is bit anemic and it did not meet my expectations. \n\nThe game is very 2-dimensional, and I don't just mean the graphical layout. The story is not very compelling and the artwork still looks like it is in the draft stages. I know we are dealing with aliens, but they tend to look very similar to one another and this is partly due to the blobby art style. Many seem to like the art, but I did not. I needed more art and description to get a better feel for what I was facing. \n\nThe combat; which is what this game is mostly about, isn't very deep and is very luck-based; the game tries to make up for that through constant opportunities to heal, leading to the lack of a feeling of gravity within the game, at least to me. I went into the game feeling like I had better be careful going into this dangerous and creepy situation and before long I was just blithely marching around blasting everything in site by tapping a button. There wasn't much challenge since it was mostly luck-based, and aren't many combat options. I kind of just wanted to turn off the whole turn-based movement and slide around the board to each enemy in turn and tap the \"kill it\" button until it was dead; the pace would have been so much faster. I've played tabletop RPGs, and the often-used comparison in these reviews of this game to a classic tabletop RPG falls very short; so far, it is largely \"find token, kill token\" without much meaningful decision-making in character \"creation\" (except maybe to increase your own chance of death by not investing in endurance), combat, or non-combat play. \n\nIf there are great tactics or nuanced mechanics in this game, I haven't found them so far. I'm level 11, yet I suspect I'll just be romping around blasting everything with my upgraded starter weapon for awhile yet, pausing every now and then to tap a spinning red thing to heal myself. \n\nAmusing, but just barely so. I am on the fence as to whether or not this was worth the price.",

                    "label": "Galactic Keep is definitely one of those games that might not really be all that appealing at first, but the more you play it, the more it'll grow on you and open up. There is no real hand-holding. There is a tutorial, but after that, it's almost an open world RPG in a tabletop setting. Where you go is completely up to you. You will die. A lot. But you have 6 or 7 characters to work with, and each time you visit your old character's dead body, all of the gear you collected can be taken and the character can then be selected again, with all their permanant stat buffs and experience in tact (that is, unless you choose to play on Hardcore mode, which offers perma-death, though I wouldn't recommend it until you've got a handle on the gameplay). Right now, there's only one part of the game, but it's about 10-12 hours worth of gameplay and the developers are working on part 2 which, from their social posts, sounds and looks FRIGGIN INCREDIBLE!! Gilded Skull Games has definitely earned itself a lot of fans because of this game... and even without the 2nd campaign, wound up being one of my favorite games of 2015. Well worth the price. Fans of turn-based RPGs, roguelikes, open world RPGs and old-school board-based Dungeon Crawlers/RPGs should jump on this ASAP.",

Combat options are binary to the point of exhaustion after your first few enemies. Every battle turns into who can whittle a health bar down faster. There is a blocking mechanic, but this only slows the battle. \n\nOnce you get past the interesting art and sound design, you just want a decent board game.",

The eerie music suits the setting admirably, and the old 1970's board RPG aesthetic is borderline genius.\n\nUnfortunately it fails almost completely as a game.  The character \"classes\" and races are very poorly differentiated, for starters:  essentially it boils down to some equipment limitations and a choice of special attack.\n\nProbably the largest problem is the manner in which combat is resolved...which is just about the entire game.  Each attack is predicated on a roll of dice, but the outcome of each such action varies wildly...a single critical hit or failure can decide an encounter.  In addition to this, there are a few large factors that operate against the player, not least of which is the encounter design.  Oftentimes during the enemy turn you will suddenly see as many as five (!) monsters, all of them bee lining to attack you in a single turn.  Since you have virtually no method of retreat (save a few rare items that don't always work), you can be forced to fight them all in a single turn, which virtually guarantees you'll hit a string of bad luck that ends your character.\n\nI'd like to see the designer of this game take the story and presentation elements and work them into a much better game.  At this point I don't see how salvaging this game is very likely though.",

Add in the hand drawn aesthetic and the creepy noir-ish sci-fi feel and you have the makings of one of the best mobile turn based games I've played. However, I found only two opportunities to use non-combat skills. If there were more RPG elements I'd be happy to change my review to 5 stars. Now, more episodes please!",

The mechanics are almost entirely for combat, with skill check being few and far between. I must say that the developers did make combat interesting with flavor text and differing effects, but the rest of the mechanics fall short. \n\nCharacter creation takes a backseat to character selection. You pick a pre-determined race/class combination and then roll stats for it, not even being able to change the characters' name.\n\nUltimately, the most saddening exclusion is in-depth star travel. A small, RPG themed trading and exploration mechanic would be nice, but as of now, the only \"sci-fi\" activity present is dungeon exploration, which to the game's credit, it does well.\n\nI cannot help but feel that the gameplay could improve if more sandbox mechanics were added, perhaps in the vein of solo Traveller bartering. As of now, the game feels like a standard RPG with some old school paint slapped on. Luckily, it seems as though the developers are continually working on the game, with the addition of better mapping features. There is still hope for star faring on your mobile devices yet, spacers.",

It feels like you went to your hobby store and bought a module for your favorite rpg. When you look at the map, you can see it has been folded, and there is a slight yellow color on the fold showing age. Thats the level of detail the guys put in. Enjoy!\n\nUpdate: I am 10 hours in now, and the game gets better and better. The strategy for fighting gets better and more complicated, making it enjoyable. Exploration is so fun. Step on every square for the best experience. You never no if some text will pop up. If I could give this a six star I would.  enjoy\n\nUpdate: once you get special items that makes the enemy miss their turn, the combat gets much too easy. These items are too powerful, causing misses up to 80% of the time. I think it should top out around 30% so the last 1/2 of the game isn't too easy.",
