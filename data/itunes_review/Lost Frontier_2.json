And the gameplay is... well, alternately wonderful and frustrating.\n\nThere seem to be no upgrades (which I find frustrating because there are so many ways to try a map with an attempt at 3 stars before its obvious that upgrades are the only way you can succeed, as there is no difficulty rating). Three star ratings seem to be for personal purposes only (so overachievers, prepare to be disappointed). And the unit limits, while nice for purposes of simplicity, can cause issues if you aren't good with a specific unit.\n\nOverall an interesting experience, but I am glad I waited for a sale.",

Sure, you can get backup men but by the time you can afford the cheapest and most useless unit, the rest of your men are already dead, or very near dead. This is stupid and completely unbalanced game play that ramps up the difficulty way too soon!\n\nAlso, three staring even the second fight is next to impossible because you have to complete it in under 7 rounds.

It just falls flat.\n\nThe one other thing that gets me is in app purchases in paid games. I usually don't buy these games, but I did in this case because I had faith in Mika Mobile. Would the boosts made the game more enjoyable for me? Possibly but I'll never know because I refuse to use IAPs for paid games. \n\nMaybe I was spoiled with the Battle Heart games? Or maybe turn based strategy games such as this aren't for me. \n\nIt's a shame too because they worked so hard for quite a while to release this and judging by the amount of reviews it doesn't appear to be a big hit. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nDid I waste my $2.99? Absolutely not. It's a finished product put out by a quality dev. If you're into this type of game maybe it's for you. It's not for me.",

Coming from someone who's played these games all his life since he was a kid I can honestly say this is right up there with the best, the only thing holding this game back is perhaps the audience and the fact that theres little to no hand holding, I don't think iOS is a platform for these kinds of games, I'm glad Mika Mobile decided to bring this here, now I and many others have something satisfying to play on this platform in the way of a tactical based RPG. My only real gripe is the lack of online multiplayer but its still a 5 star game regardless.",

The music, sound effects, the story (still haven't beat it). The only thing that lets me down is the battle animations. When you compare this game to other strategy RPGs it excels in all area except for that. Take, in my opinion, the greatest strategy RPG ever, fire emblem. You move your units across the map, the same way you do this, but when you come into conflict you go into a better graphics fight. I know it's something petty, but it's one of the small things I've always enjoyed about other. Also the in app purchases for a paid for game. Other than those two things the game is still with the 2.99$, just not 5 stars.",

Maps are hard and there are some moments that depend on luck. There's some element also of getting used to how the AI makes its decisions which can make the game feel more luck driven than it may be.\n\nAnother thing they've done well is the IAP system, which effectively let's you pay very minimal prices to get access to quasi-expansions. I applaud this choice as it will hopefully help Mika stay afloat and allows players to pay for as much extra content (up to a point) as they'll enjoy. It's elegantly and non-intrusively implemented.\n\nThe game I was hoping this would be was a tactical turn based replayable RPG (with randomized maps) in which I could play the Legend characters as a single party together on each map. Perhaps they'll make an expansion like that. A turn-based western-themed battle heart, I suppose (FFT-like). I recognize if that's what I want I should look elsewhere as that's clearly not the game Mika wanted to make, and it would be hopelessly foolish for me to review them on the basis of what they didn't want to make.\n\nOverall fun game, would recommend for folks who like unit-driven tactical strategy games.\n\nI'll add this: your mileage will vary for replay value. If you like pass-n-play multiplayer you'll enjoy this one, if you don't you'll be playing the same missions over and over with slightly varied unit characteristics.\n\nLastly, minor bug: the necromancer's perk that makes graveyards heal also heals enemy units -_-",

Let me explain - it's like playing a game of chess repeatedly except the opponent has 4 times the number of chess pieces and has setup the board so massively in his favor that there is only one possible way to win. Not only that but the opponent can infinitely respawn new units every turn (from all of the bases it gave itself at the start of the game of course!). To compound things further, you can only get 3*s on a level if you finish with very few units defeated (I can live with that) and - and this is what makes me fuming - within an impossibly short timeframe. It's a miracle to win a level at all, but when you see that 1* you worked so hard for it just makes you feel sad. It's a shame because the game has real potential if they just fixed the reward: pain ratio and gave greater flexibility to the player in terms of strategies to win. I absolutely love these kind of strategy games and thrive off the challenge. Unfortunately this game offers me zero motivation to carry on given the pain and heavily stacked odds in the AI's favor. Stay clear of this game unless you're a masochist.",

It is extremely difficult to be OCD and get all the stars but it is complete able nonetheless. Overall this game is wonderful and has had me hooked for several days playing this over some more in depth games I have and enjoy. Would love to see a map editor which would add even more replay ability but overall a great game that gave me a bit of nostalgia with some wonderful new and exciting environment.",

You can pass each mission with 1-3 stars; if you just go for 1 star it's pretty easy. But going for all 3 is quite challenging, even on the early missions. \n\nIf you like Fire Emblem (or FF Tactics) you will most definitely get your money's worth.",

I did find the matches a little chaotic though with multiple players all going and moving several units. I did also encounter a few bugs along the way with camerawork and a couple weird story missions. There is like no real explanation to what strategy in the game looks like, but I loved that aspect!

Also, it is difficult to determine enemy troop ranges because game does not show potential maneuverability, just where they can move at the moment. This is problematic when I am trying to get my troops out of enemy range but when I move my troops, the range changes because my troops were blocking the other troops' movement ranges. For example, my medic and gunslinger are in range of a cavalry, so I move them both back one space each. But now they are still in enemy range because my medic and gunslinger were just blocking its full range and giving it a smaller range, but now since they moved back a space the cavalry is able to use its full range and still attack them. Plz plz just make it easier to see the enemy troops' actual ranges.\n\nSuper super annoying thing:\n\nWhile playing as Wyatt Wilcox I unlocked the skill to give my riflemen the ability to shoot one space away, but this ability does not apply to my \"living legend\" himself. Therefore, my regular riflemen are almost superior to Wyatt Wilcox because they can shoot point-blank and he can not. This doesn't make sense because Wyatt is supposed to be the best rifleman but the regular expendable riflemen are better. \n\nThere should be a skill tree for the living legends as well. \n\nSome levels are challenging in a fun way. However, some levels are just plain hard and boring because the enemy has such a huge advantage. In fact, some levels take up to an hour to complete(50 rounds).",

The characters are well designed and the layers of strategy are thick. I definitely recommend it.\n\nThat being said, I do have a handful of gripes. The difficulty is a bit ridiculous at the beginning, but with a little patience, you'll slowly develop your strategy and get the hang of it. Even while improving your tactics, I wouldn't necessarily consider it well-balanced.\n\nThere are a few missed opportunities... I agree with reviews that criticize the lack of user-control while leveling up. It would at least be nice to have a summary of the Legends' stats so you can compare strengths/weaknesses between the characters. When I see 5% increase of some stat, that increase is relative to only that character... I have no frame of reference to how it compares to other characters.\n\nAlso ‚Äî a minor detail and miscellaneous observation ‚Äî the level select seems like it needs to be visualized over a map of some kind as opposed to a table. That would be more conceptually relevant to the story.\n\nThe most significant issue with the game is that a character can reach maximum level before their story is complete. The problem with this is that while playing the later levels, your character doesn't gain any more experience while attempting to beat a level. So if you're defeated before completing that level, you don't receive any experience and therefore you have nothing to show for it. In my experience, this diminishes motivation for completing the game with that particular character.\n\nDespite those fairly minor issues in the big picture, this is a great game and I'm looking forward to future updates!",

You can literally feel that it's one sided which kills interest. I am stuck at level 16 from last 4 days. \nAnother boring part is that you cannot skip opponents move. U have to wait until opponent completes his move, you have fast forward option but still it takes time and Kills fun.\nThere are similar turned based strategic games but this one has potential to be unique with several changes.",

But having 9 different legends/heroes to play through the game with, each with their own strengths/weaknesses, and each with their own 'save' (you'll have to start from Stage 1 if you're playing with a Legend you've never played with before, regardless of how far you've gone/what level you are with another character), has added just enough to really shine as it's own entity. And to clear things up - you do not have to pay to get the extra heroes. You start with 3 and unlock the other 6 as you progress through the game. The IAPs are ONLY THERE IF YOU WANT TO INSTANTLY MAKE YOUR LEGEND A LEVEL 40 CHARACTER (MAX LEVEL). That's it. The difficulty is a bit on the high side... but if you're a strategy fan, chances are it'll be just difficult enough to provide a decent challenge, and if you do ever get stuck, you can go back and replay previous levels to earn more EX and level up your character a bit before trying it again. But there really is no hand-holding here. It's a strategy game, and wears that title as a badge of honor. \nThe only real negative thing I can say about the game is that units are unlocked/brought out a little slow. It would have been nice to have everything by stage 5-6-7, somewhere in there... but this is just a personal preferance. All units are unlocked in the other two modes; Challenge Maps (pre-made skirmish-like maps with goals like the Story Mode [defeat all enemies/less than x casulties/finish before turn x/ect...]) and Custom Game (single-device pass-n-play with 2-4 players). So I really can't complain. I do hope to see some online MP, which is strange, because I'm not really a fan of MP... but for whatever reason, I'd love to see it implemented here. Even without that.... this is a must own for strategy fans, though, if you're not a strategy fan, I'd go and read some reviews/watch some gameplay videos before diving in, even if you loved Mika Mobile's previous offerings. This might not be the best game to ease you into the genre... =oP\n\nTHANK YOU MIKA!!! =oD",

As a 2016 game, did not bring any new ideas into this kind of strategy games. 10 levels into this game and you feel many other old games already had everything this game offers, even better. \n2. Design many units, however the game just gives them to you without any cost, challenge or sense of rewarding. And there is no telling if new units actually help you in situations.\n3. Level design doesn't make you feel you \"earned\" something.you just...beat the game...and nothing. No sense of achievement or complement. \n\nOverall,I'm  very disappointed this is a 2016 game. If this is the best they can do after battleheart. I'm sure something is not right in this company.",

This is especially so for the spell casting undead that get extreme range and damage and can attack and move on the same turn. To make matters worse they turn the defenses they kill against. This game could be solid but with ridiculous difficulty its just extremely dumb and boring. As the game is now its not worth the 3 bucks",
