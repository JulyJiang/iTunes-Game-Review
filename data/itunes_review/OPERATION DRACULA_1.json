I fired up the free version again, and about 2 days later, I picked up this paid build. \nI have no clue what took me so long to get into it, or why I kept just glancing over this version while scrolling through the AppStore, but I'm kicking myself for it now. \nThis is a GREAT shoot-em-up, with FANTASTIC visuals, sounds, scoring and a hardcore difficulty that should keep even the most seasoned bullet-hell gamers wildly entertained - and this is coming from someone that is VERY picky about their SHMUPS. This fits right in with the 10 or so other top notch titles that are not offloaded in my SHMUP folder right now (4 of which are Cave offerings). So, if that tells you anything.... .... I'd be surprised to hear of any serious fan of the genre bad mouth  this one. \nOh, and THANK YOU for keeping this title active all these years (especially after the 'OS update that shall never be mentioned'). You guys rock!",

Easier to dodge.  \n\nIf you don't care about points, boss 2 can easily be beat by running the clock and looming behind him until he shoots missles.\n\nBoss 3 all I can say is baby steps all around.  Resist jumping all over the place.\n\nBoss 4 his first move is aimed at you so time it so you move far away just as he launches those missles.  That will ease the pain. I go to the upper left corner when he launches bombs. \n\nLast guy is pretty easy. Stay left when he uses bats. You can dodge easy from there. The rest is just gently dodging bullets.",

You don't really have to leave like an inch big section on the bottom of the screen even. I have no idea how to beat the stage 4 boss without dying a bunch but the cylinders (not diamonds) he shoots at you don't hurt so don't bother trying to dodge them.  I'm sure it's beatable but itseriously crazy hard. 99% of the players probably don't make it through half the game.  I've been looking for a game like this for awhile and this is great.

Basically punishes people by leaving them underpowered most of the time as this game gets pretty hard. Bosses wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the lasers and homing missiles. Hate those things! There is too much going on sometimes that can make bullets hard to distinguish. Finally, why are there not alternate control options? Double tap and bomb bar tapping interrupts me dodging bullets and moving the ship. Add a two tap option or buttons at least... \n\nOverall, great presentation but lacking in polish compared to CAVE, Danmaku Unlimited, and Decluster. It's just not that fun to play.

This is a big issue for a game like this considering the fact that it requires you to move your ship at all times to avoid dying.
