It just feels like the game has an unfair advantage against the player. Along with the micro transactions, it feels more like a pay to win game. I had fun for the first hour but the constant “You’ll roll low every time “ thing is highly irritating to the point I don’t want to play and it definitely doesn’t get me in the mood to drop money on it.",

Problem is, you only have TWO you can pick from. It also tells you you can make your own, but as far as I can tell it’s just you renaming an existing character.\n\nTo get more characters you have to pay real money, or I suppose grind like crazy to try and unlock one of the goblin versions of them... which I’m not sure would actually unlock the character or not tbh.",

Regardless of what actions I take, within 10-30 seconds of clicking anything on the menu screen the game crashes. Normally I would just delete and forget, but I used this as an alternative to picking up the physical game and have made more than my share of in game purchases.\n\nThis issue has persisted for over a year now over two different iPhone models and an iPad. This is rather disheartening and  caused me to make the decision to no longer support anything from the developers/publishers no matter how appealing. I’ll update the review if anything ever gets fixed, but I doubt it will.",

I love that you can be in the middle of a battle, and you suddenly need to close the game for some unexpected reason and when you reopen, you are exactly where you left off!.  You can play for one minute or 5+ hours (like I have before), and it’s a new challenge every time. \n   The game does give you small amounts of gold for closing each small area, and new cards to use or sell for 1 gold each. It is a bit of a grinch game but that is what I like. I have spent some money on gold and a few chests. Guaranteed high level items in 1 of 4. Get this game if you want something to do to fill the gaps in your bus ride, waiting at the Dr. Office or just chilling in bed before sleeping. Just a fun game!",

                    "label": "I see a lot of reviews on here that are complaining about a pay wall and it’s unfair to rate a great game with low stars based on that factor alone.  Most games on IOS are pay to play these days.  It’s just a fact of life now so instead of complaining about the fact you have to pay to unlock additional scenarios let’s focus on how many positive notes this game hits.  (I’d also like to mention that the actual tabletop Pathfinder Adventure Card Game requires you to pay for each additional scenario as an expansion so this is no different other than you get to play the first three missions for FREE in this version)\nSo here are the pros:\n-Plays exactly like the tabletop version\n-great graphics and cards are detailed \n-actually adds more storyline with cut scenes making it feel more like an adventure and less random \n-you don’t have to remember all of the rules associated with each card which makes things much easier \n-feels like an actual campaign \n-Game mechanics work well \nCons:\n-it’s a little clunky if you haven’t played the table top version so may take some time to understand the nuances and game mechanics \nIn closing I would like to see some of the expansions developed in the iOS version as this is a great adaptation of the tabletop version",

It usually takes me a few tries to win a scenario, to get to know it and plan for it.  I love the challenge. It is one of the few iPad games that I enjoy the playing of itself, rather than the enjoyment of “winning” or “gacha” aspects where you are collecting heroes or whatnot.  In this game, I really enjoy the whole experience.  I purchased the entire set of adventures, which is well worth it for the price, especially if you enjoy the introduction.\n\nThe story/dialogue is brief but funny and enjoyable too.  I am getting attached to my heroes!  It did take me some time to really understand all the rules but that’s part of the fun.",

Literally everything costs real money to unlock...additional characters (past the first 2), missions, etc. etc.\n\n Very, VERY disappointing from a pen-and-paper rpg company that is open source for all of their pen-and-paper content and whose developers and authors allegedly left Wizards of the Coast due to their constant rebooting in pursuit of gold pieces. This is an especially awful example as everything has a cost. Nickel and dimes forever\n\nThis game has loads of potential and could have an easy fix by initiating a daily energy allotment for free-to-play players. As a general rule I ABSOLUTELY will not spend money on games that have no possible ftp option. It’s my way of returning the foul solo digit offered by pay-to-play/win only games.",
