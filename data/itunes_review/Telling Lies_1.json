I don’t have that kind of time to waste and it can be quite boring at times. Another annoyance was the fact that most of the videos did not start at the beginning, so before you could watch them, you have to rewind, which took too much time. It’s a bummer because I can tell a lot of thought and effort went into the game, but it was a waste of $6.99 for me because my “play-time” is limited and I don’t want to spend what little time I do have rewinding videos and staring at a silent screen.",

I was driven mad trying to figure out why and thinking I had lost all that time and might have to start over... I even came and wrote a one star review detailing this issue as unacceptable (which it would be)... BUT I figured out the issue has something to do with Bluetooth audio! I play almost all my iPad games with audio going through Bluetooth to my headset. Never had a problem with it. After I left my review here, I decided to try a few more random things to get the game to avoid crashing, and one of those things was turning off the iPad’s Bluetooth and viola, game started up and allowed me to continue playing without any further issue... WHEW!\n\nDevs, please look into this as a possible need to patch; most people who experience a problem like this would likely not troubleshoot as much as I have to get around it.\n\nNow that the problem is solved and the crashing has stopped, I’ve been able to return to playing with Bluetooth on and have happily been back to obsessing about these characters and this enrapturing story!",

The goal of solving a mystery isn’t quite present, unlike ‘Her Story’, and it frankly ruins the game entirely. Very disappointing. And the endings? What utter crap. I almost feel more robbed seeing those endings than I did when there was no ending at all. Ugh.\n\nAnd perhaps I missed something, but I didn’t see any way to jump to the beginning of a video without having to waste time on the slowest rewind feature since VHS. So annoying it made me want to give up several times (if I could have found a decent summary online, I would have quit solely for this reason like thirty minutes in). \n\nMeh.",

One of the things that bugs me is the one sided conversations, I really wish it was possible to open two windows to watch the conversations instead of trying to remember a 3-7 minute convo, finding the related video it goes with and listen and try to remember what the person you’re watching now is responding to and the questions being asked or the answers. It’s a lot of going back and forth. The next HUGE problem, which I will get my money back for being unplayable and broken, is the crashing. After about a couple of minutes the game crashes. Open it back up and you’re stuck in a crash loop that will never resolve itself. Close out the program in the game computer stops the crash but as soon as you play a video you’re back in the crashing loop. Only temporary fix is uninstalling and reinstalling the game but you have to start over and all my notes got deleted. So no kind of local or cloud save. Could be fun, nice change of pace, no saving and horrible bugs that makes the game unplayable.\n\nUpdate: So doing as the developers suggested, I emailed them my problem, my phone version and software version....Still no answer and it’s been a week now. How do you expect people to “enjoy” your “story game” when none of the story makes any sense. I get you have to piece together your own story and what not but what’s the point when IT DOES NOT WORK? Not so much as a automated message from them like most developers. Garbage!!",

I started playing and the game play is pretty vague and you just kind of figure it out. Which isn’t bad, I’ve played games like this before. However, it can get a little boring and tedious. It’s hard to piece together the video calls when you can only hear one side of a conversation at a time. Like, I wish there was a way to see the video calls synced once you find the other half. Also, the forward and rewind process is ridiculously slow! Omg. I search a word and it brings me to the end of 7 mins video call and it take me soooo long to rewind to the beginning. Most importantly though, I have no idea how to “win” this game. Like is there a real objective. There are no like check points or rewards for finding something out. Idk if I’m evening doing it right. It’s kind of irritating. I play for like 20 mins and then I get bored and frustrated and play another time. I wanna complete the game but it’s getting hard to keep my interest. \n\nOverall, the concept seemed promising but the execution is not ideal. I want to like this game but I’m having hard time getting myself into it. Usually I’m hooked by this point with games like this. Maybe it’s just me? Hopefully I can complete the game and enjoy the work I put into. But I’m feeling doubtful.",

The gameplay is awesome without any flaws, touch responsiveness is on par without any complaints, video quality is superb..no blurry effects (on iPhone 8 anyways) and the acting is very good also with smooth performance.
