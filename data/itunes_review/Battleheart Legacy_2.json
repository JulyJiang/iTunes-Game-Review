                    "label": "Well done dev and design team on Battleheart Legacy!  It’s like diablo 3 for your phone but lighter and more cartoonish.  \n\nThere’s some design decisions I really appreciate in the game that I hope other RPG makers would take note of. Number 1: there is no monster scaling!  A wolf is a wolf. A green orc archer is a green orc archer.  There’s no monsters that look exactly the same but have an inflated monster level associated with them.  So that makes your character level matter.  There are level numbers labeled on different areas but that’s just to let you know the difficulty.  A level 7 area might have 1 ogre at the end while a level 15 area might jump right into 3 ogres at once but the ogres are the same unless it’s a boss ogre or green ogre .  \n\nThe character progression and classes are handled very well and allow for interesting combinations, and the pacing of power increase from leveling is very good — it’s not too extreme like Diablo.  \n\nThe equipment is fairly good — simplified which makes sense for a phone game.  Feels like it could be a bit better in terms of adding special equipment or weapons with weird abilities but maybe that’s in the end game — my character is level 20.\n\nOverall, on of the best iPhone games!  And no in app fleecing.  You get the whole game .  I do hope there is a sequel or expansion.\n\nOh one more criticism.  The melee classes don’t auto attack if you are out of range. You have to move to them and then attack .  So I recommend a ranged or magic character.  Dev, please add an option to have melee characters automatically move to and attack when you click on an enemy. \n\nWizard teleport plus necro corpse explosion is really fun btw.  You can mix different classes skills do make your own combos.",

It has character development depth, but not overly complicated,  like Baldur’s Gate for mobile for example. It’s a good mix between casual and in-depth. You can pick this game up in minutes, but spend weeks playing and replaying it with different character builds.\nDefinitely worth trying.",

This game blew my expectations out of the water and easily became my favorite game. I now have over 300+ hours and completed the game multiple times with most classes and is still fun to play. Now that being said this game takes a while to get good but climbing the ladder to victory was an enjoyable experience. I only found one bug in my years playing it. You can teleport in some rocks with the wizard’s active teleport  or the ninja’s passive teleport, but is very easy to avoid as long as you don’t tap on the rocks.(which is very easy not to do) This game is incredibly smooth with reliable data saves. If you are looking at getting an RPG on your phone I very much advise that you get this game. Well worth the money.",

Years later I can hop back on and make a new build and take different paths to make a very fun and entertaining experience for a second time. The dialogue can be witty and well done, and the gameplay is fluid and smooth. Its art style isn’t as charming as the original Battleheart, yet it still manages to be a vibrant interpretation that’s altered slightly from the four-partied original. The beginning and ending are very well done and are enticing and interesting, but the middle game (12-25) tends to be very lackluster. Every good RPG has a good grind, but sometimes it can feel too grind-y. I’m personally very excited for Battleheart 2 and hope they make the game feel amazing through the entire experience! Thanks MikaMobile for your fabulous IOS game that will be one of my all time favorites.",

However, the one problem with this game is that there aren’t very many NPC related storylines, for example, if you try to learn the Ninja class, you eventually get in a fight with the knights. After this you say that you can help the Ninjas bye getting the guards off their back. However this never progresses. In the game you are also able to join the Cartel at multiple points, but it never develops. This is a very fun game and I think these types of stories would make it even better",

I’ve already played the tutorial but already I have problems.\n\n1. Character moves WAY too slow. This will get very annoy very fast.\n\n2. The game forces you to get near someone to talk to them. I understand why it’s this way for combat. But tapping on a friendly should allow me to talk them no matter how close or far my character and the NPC are from each other. At the very least auto-walk my character to that NPC. Have to tap near that NPC to move my character near them is wearing thin on my patience. And some NPCs move around! Even when you walk into a single room are (like a house) you’re forced to do this!\n\n3. You’re forced to tap the (X) to close dialog boxes. This is annoying for 2 reasons.\n- I keep trying to tap ANYWHERE OUTSIDE the dialog box to end a chat. Just like all other games let you do.\n- Playing the on a tablet, it’s more comfortable to have my hands on the left and right of the screen. And it’s annoying to keep moving my hands off the side to tap the bottom-middle. Maybe give players a choice to use the left or right side for more comfort. I get that it makes sense to place it on the bottom if I was playing this on a phone but I’m on a big tablet!\n\n4. Why can’t I double tap on a spot to move? I know you can hold the button down but again other games don’t make you do this!\n\nListen, I bought this game because it got a lot of high praise and it lets you play offline. But this issues are getting in the way of me enjoying it. I’m sure I’m in the minority but if it matters to you I think working out these quality of life issues would make for a better game.\n\nThank you.",

The humor is spot on, and the animations are great. I’ve been playing as a mage, but am just as excited to play the game again as a different class. Plus NO in game advertising or sales that I’ve seen. Want a game you can spend en a tire weekend in front of, or pick up when you have 5 or 10 minutes that always fun, this is it. \n \nThe follow in for the developers and not a criticism of the game. In a new release, I would offer mini maps for individual missions/battles, some more enemy info, and the ability to undo purchases ( I’ve double clicked by accident more than once) This is one of the most fun games I’ve ever played.",

The game is well balanced, challenging, creative, and the class system gives an impressive amount of freedom for customization.  The storyline is simple and funny and good enough. The mechanics are well developed but different: this game doesn’t feels like it copies anything.  I particularly liked the fact that it dispenses with a crafting system, which I find tiresome in modern rpgs.\n\nMy only complaint is that the depth and variability of the story and available quests is quite limited and limits replayability significantly, even when you switch classes.  I won the game once and really enjoyed the whole experience.  Now I am in the middle of replaying a second time with an entirely different class but still find myself getting bored.  \n\nThat is not, in my view, a sufficient reason to give less than five stars. But if the developers are listening, try playing the avernum games. Mix that broad and wide experience with this approach and you’d have something really unmatched.

Also add multiplayer like as in joining worlds from the same wifi multiplayer. And yeah that's pretty much it. If you could add theses in future updates that would be great!",
