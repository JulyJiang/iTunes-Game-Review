You have to have a good amount of patience to get through the tutorials, and once you get a few scenarios down, a sort or analytical rhythm should be forming that’ll make the experience really fun and fulfilling. If the app icon didn’t make it apparent, this game acts like tabletop rpg games except without game masters and the imagination of players, but if you’re looking into tabletop gaming, this could be a good place to get settled into the dice, character, and turn mechanics that many games have. My biggest gripe about the game is the many bugs that pop up very randomly when i’m making plays that should save me some damage or get me a much needed item. Sometimes revealing a shield won’t give the said effect, or an enemy’s roll for damage won’t be affected by what their card says. It can be a little disheartening to see mechanics of the game switch and break, for almost no apparent reason. All in all, this is a very solid card rpg, that definitely deserves a try if you’re willing to put some careful thought into.",

Starting with the original two characters was not fulfilling the very next mission due to a series of “unfortunate” odds. I literally failed it 6 times on the easiest difficulty when I was able to pass the intro adventures in legendary difficulty with ease. \n\nWhen an opportunity is showing a 95% success rate and it fails, the statistics of that are slim, but still possible. When that happens 3 times in a single scenario, that’s unreal. I feel that there are “weighted” odds to encourage players to buy more items to increase their odds which is unfortunate since the people playing these scenarios have ALREADY SPENT MONEY ON THIS GAME.\n\nBe cautious, reader. Play the free part, it’s pretty fun and easy. The odds don’t work that way when you buy one of the adventures. Just an FYI.",

It takes the concepts from a collectible card game and applies them to an rpg campaign in an interesting way and it’s fun to strategize and play the different adventures.\nI dropped one star because there are still some bugs and I find some of the systems clunky, particularly around managing your “stash” and “unclaimed” cards. Why can’t I just include any card I’ve earned or bought in one of my decks? Why do I have to switch between two tabs just to change out  one card?\nThere’s one major problem though and it lost this game an entire star from me. It’s the final scenario of the final adventure. Other scenarios change the rules in interesting ways that make you shift your strategy, this one just makes it an incredibly boring slog that feels like an endless series of rolling die to make a check you’re never going to pass, then rolling die to see how much damage you took, then repeating this for every other character in your party. If you have poor luck you may have to face the boss over and over, taking automatic damage for every party member each time until it’s just impossible to win. On top of this, the cards that have effects that could mitigate this problem (Scrying and Augury, for example) have a bug that causes the game to freeze so you have to fully reset the game to continue when this happens and makes them impossible to use in this scenario. This makes the ultimate scenario, which should be the best one in the game, one of the worst cases of bad level design I’ve ever seen.\nI’d be happy to change this review if this problem was addressed.",

I cannot find a dice rolling DnD style game for mobile. However, this game hits all the spots. It is fun, fast and a joy to play. I am disappointed in users complaining that it is not free to play. It is a good quality game. You can download for free and play to see if you like it (like Mario Run). I see this as a demo (like PS1-PS1 era of gaming). If you like it you can buy it. I bought it and love it. I hope users support this game because it is top notch and I am enjoying every minute. Also, for someone who likes DnD but has a family and work, and cannot sit down to set up and play the Pathfinders board game, this is amazing! Please bring the other Pathfinder board games to mobile!",

My one con is that the leveling up system is pretty stunted. The main way you improve your character is through deck building, but adding skills to the skill tree takes too long (finished the first three scenarios and still no growth, not sure when I’ll get to add a skill or if I will). I guess I’m used to other RPG’s where skill tree progression is a bit quicker. Other than that, this game is FANTASTIC!! Are there frustrating dice rolls? Absolutely! Does that happen when I tabletop game? Absolutely! The advantage here is that I don’t have to figure the odds myself, the computer does it for me, which actually leads to LESS frustration (except for those few times that your probability is above 80% and you still fail). I’m going to be buying the full version of this game more than likely. \n\nI am really enjoying the freeware version of this game. Yes, you will eventually have to pay for content. The cheapest base set of the physical game is $41 on Amazon...so the portability here makes it a pretty good value I think. I have encountered a couple of bugs, like tutorial pop ups getting stuck on screen, but when I finish the current action, they go away and everything moves on. I haven’t noticed buggy dice rolls like some claim, bad rolls just happen sometimes, like in a physical game. The dice rolling is quite possibly my favorite part and what has won me over big time to this game. I just love rolling the dice onscreen. Why have more games not done this? How man “build the buildings and tap them for resources” games have we seen versus any kind of tactical battle game where you roll the dice for combat?? Get the free version and try it out, you owe yourself at least that much if you’re a table top gamer.",

As others mention, it’s pricey to purchase characters, scenarios, and expansions, but I find the depth of play, customization, combos, and necessity for strategy well worth it. \n\nScenarios adapt to the number of characters in your party, and since cards always shuffled, you never get the same game twice.  This results in a feeling of randomness where luck is a *really* big factor.  That can be both a frustration, and a motivator to come back with a different strategy.\n\nOverall, I enjoy and recommend this app for anyone who’s looking for a solo strategic deckbuilder/RPG.",

Last week I spent the $15 and it worked well all week. I was able to sign in and even transfer to my iPad to play. Then out of no where everything just stopped working. It says I logged in but I don’t have any of my adventures or characters I paid for. It doesn’t work on my iPhone or iPad. All my progress lost.  If it gets fixed then the game deserves 10 stars out of 5. I love the game but losing all progress makes the game crap.",

                    "label": "Edit5: I came back after a year. Most of the horrific game breaking bugs seem to be fixed. However there are still major ones hanging around. For instance, I used strength, a weapon, and an animal with Lini. Then I went to try another combination without the weapon (doing a dex check). The strength spell was permanently attached to the screen until combat was resolved. One of the biggest problems with this version is the price tag on everything. If you want to play the full game, it is around $40 USD. That is completely absurd. There is no way this quality of game is worth $40. Maybe $10 total at this point of its development.\n\nOriginal: But the tutorial lasted forever. I just wanted to play. I didn't care about winning or losing. That tutorial just kept going on and on.\n\nEdit: I gave this a second chance. After you get through the horrible tutorial, it is a fantastic game. All they should tell you is that there are reveals, recharges, discards, banishes and buries. That is the only thing that warrants explanation. The rest is easy to pick up.\n\nEdit2: The game was fantastic even with lots of bugs. Now, there are just so many bugs, after the update that the game is completely unplayable. I am trapped at a game breaking mission complete screen bug. The card floats off of the screen and I can't tap to accept or move on. Can you just program in an auto-accept for card rewards? Multiple taps to accept a card is unnecessary anyway. Unity is such a buggy engine. I feel bad for Paizo.\n\nEdit3: latest update fixed a lot of the bugs. However, I just can't bring myself to get into the game again after the incredibly buggy start/launch. I think this game is great. Hopefully new players will get into it.\n\nEdit4: went for another go after this past update. Cards are flying off the screen again...",

I spent $20 on this, and to this day I am regretting this purchase. It’s embarrassing to even suggest this for people to purchase, items in game don’t work the way they’re supposed to, character abilities are not triggering the way they should.

So it asks me to put some stuff in stash and afterwards tells me to sell some stuff from the stash thats the issue though. It is forcing me to give up my items into my stash and then forcing me to sell some of it because theres no room in the stash! Luckily it was only one item I needed to sell. I still really question the concept of how that was gonna play out later on in the gameplay. Hopefully nothing that might ruin the gameplay. I try again and again I fail. And now I have to sell more stuff. Left the game came back tried again and it wouldn't let me continue my campaign until i rid of my stuff. Is it just me or are you forcing us to lose items for losing a quest. Especially when its my first real quest. You'd think you'd be more forgiving or at least mention it in the tutorial. But nope for both! So tell me again Why do we have to permanently rid our stuff for losing? The game was great but that one single part that will not let me progress in the actual campaign itself was stupid! Worst part was had a sold those id have barely anything left to actually be able to fight with i already lost the first match WITH all my items now i'm just gonna lose more? You shouldn't force someone to rid all their items just give them a card limit and an inventory limit and some time before getting rid of it all. Rather than making a number per card type Weapons-1 Potions-2 Allies-3 etc. It should just be a number for character card limits rather its potions or weapons it counts it all together. Besides even as a card limit per type the limit is very low a majority of mine was 1. so that was bs. So please fix this.",

Then I found out that you have to purchase every character with real money (except the first two).  This apparently is a recent change, whereas earlier versions allowed some content to be accessed via in-game currency.\n\nPoor choice by the Devs: all or nothing. This might work for fans of the game, but for someone who is exploring and getting to know the game, this rude, cold, shut-the-door-in-your-face attitude makes me the opposite of a fan.\n\nInteresting that many, many online games these days use expert psychology to draw in new players and get them hooked on the game so they are more likely to pay.  These devs must have missed that memo.",

                    "label": "I love the mechanics of the game and each scenario not only feels unique but different difficulties give extra flair. You feel an actual sense of progress as you incrementally upgrade your characters and their builds. There is also incentive to try new cards or builds just to get through certain missions and to even acquire \"junk\" items to banish during some missions. I also don't mind paying for content either as I feel I'm getting my money's worth for the time spent in game.\n\nSo why not five stars? The first issue I have is that the app crashes too frequently, usually when starting a scenario or managing items/party size. You don't lose any mission progress when this happens but if you spent twenty minutes rearranging your inventory to determine what to sell off, it's frustrating to redo it. It also breaks the immersion.\n\nSecond is the stash and character inventory system. As soon as a mission ends, you need to sell off cards to get down to 10 in your stash, before you have the opportunity to transfer those items to your nonparty characters. You also need to make sure each of your characters are at their card limits, which means you sometimes have to sell things you don't want to or you have to add a junk spell or item just to fill the requirement before you can rearrange. This could be easier to solve if you weren't forced to lower your stash or adjust your characters until your next mission attempt. Instead this process happens immediately after a mission ends.\n\n If I were to make a suggestion, it would be to not allow characters to be in missions unless they are valid and not allow a new mission to begin until the stash is valid. Then get rid of the post-mission stash trim step. That way, I can just rearrange everything between my characters and my mules in one step instead of trimming the stash, then dispersing items to mules and bringing in junk to fit card limits, then bringing in items I really want to use from other mules and dispersing the junk so the mules are again legal.\n\nFixing the crashes would be a higher priority though.\n\nEdit: Well I've gotten to the fourth adventure in the last scenario where you get the loot pile from defeating banes. The app was already crashing repeatedly as I tried shuffling cards among mule characters. The last two or so days, the app crashes when a new scenario starts, which means I have to think through how I placed the heroes. It also crashes multiple times during a scenario sometimes causing a turn to skip or a spell to be unplaced. But what made me change my review is after finishing that scenario I had a stash size of 65+. Before the scenario started I had some repair items (Blessings of the Gods) in my stash. After spending 10+ minutes three times in a row getting my characters down to \"legal size\" so I can sell off the stash items, the app crashes as soon as I move a blessing of the gods to the sell pile. I tried removing the repair blessings out, which would've forced me to sell off better blessings, except it crashes even if I sell a non repair blessings. I have about five blessings of the gods in my stash. I can try keeping them as 5/10 of my stash but I get the feeling the app would crash on something else. Because of this I can't even get on to the next adventure either.\n\nI do like the game so I bought the Steam version and linked my accounts. That let me sort out my inventory and get unstuck.\n\nI'm fine with keeping a stash system and would even pay real money or gold to have a larger one, but there needs to be an easier way to swap items between characters that doesn't cause crashing and forces me to wonder where I reset to and what I have to redo.\n\nI hate doing this but I've changed the rating to one star until crashes fixed and stash management gets easier.\n\n3/3 Edit: I stopped playing about three months ago because my stash kept crashing. The new patch was supposed to help with crashes so I was eager to give it another try. I was able to sort out my stash finally. Continued my scenario and it immediately crashed. Started up the app again and played through a mission without problems (and was happy Ransack worked). Next I played Sandpoint under Siege. Used Blessing of Nethys to pick my next encounter. Both were monsters which triggered Longtooth... but the icon to summon him immediately disappeared. So I'm stuck again and will have to restart the scenario. The app feels stabler in terms of stash management but based on the forum posts it seems the Devs aren't even sure what the future holds (devs returned to the game but no long term plan?) . Meanwhile I'll maintain my love/hate relationship with this game and hope it gets back to five star stability soon.",
