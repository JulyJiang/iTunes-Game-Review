There is one thing that I think would be cool to add to the game. I think that there should be different weather changes and there should be a night time and day time (like Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild). Also, I would really like to see a prequel to this game where you are Master Mayfair in the Direfolk Wars. Or at least a character who fought in that war. That would be a really fun game explaining what happened before in more detail. Overall, I rate this game 5 stars and would totally recommend it to a friend.",

I gave only 3 stars because as great as it is, I could be improved for more fluid game play. The touch screen controls are frustrating at times, directions in combat can be very challenging to control. I know that a Bluetooth gaming controller would probably improve that drastically, but this is a mobile game....in the App Store, for mobile devices. I‚Äôd prefer the quality of touch screen to be improved rather than relying/pushing for people to play with gaming controls. \n\nAlso, Gen and Trin are very close to useless and get in the way so much. I understand they have to follow, but do they really need to get shoulder to shoulder....even during combat?? I have wasted so many bullets and bombs from them literally just walking right in the path of my shot. Not even to fight, just to stand next to me. They also do not consistently follow orders to attack and hit things. The only benefit I‚Äôve found so far is when I need three people to stand on triggers for puzzles. They don‚Äôt add anything to the game for me, and actually make it really frustrating to play. It would be great if they weren‚Äôt programmed to be so clumsy and slow. Or just to automatically attack the closest enemy to them. \n\nHowever, the game truly is incredible as far as how far the technology has come with graphics. It‚Äôs crazy we can play these types of games on our phones, so I look forward to the improvements in mobile gaming technology.",

I think being able to calibrate/move UI a bit would help some of us fat thumbed folks haha. Otherwise the art is nice and the puzzles are pretty enjoyable.",

The direction of the cut-scenes isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve seen of other Apple Arcade games, let alone phone games. The directing in and of itself is what compelled me to 4 stars instead of 3. The vibe to it is very Zelda-esqe in overall environment and game play, mixed with Shadow of the Colossus style boss fights.  \nThe controls are a bit janky, but my biggest complaint has to be auto-jump. There was so many times where being able to control my jumps would‚Äôve gotten me out of an easily avoidable jam but alas...auto-jump. I‚Äôd also recommend separating the interact with environment button from the attack button. The amount of times I went to smash a pot but picked it up instead is astronomical. There‚Äôs also a severe lack of facial expressions in every cutscene. Characters look bored but their voices tell a different story. \n\nSpeaking of characters, every last one of them is white. Even the NPC‚Äôs just walking around are white. The fact that me, a white person, was so alarmed at how white every single person in this game was is really telling. Developers, it‚Äôs not hard to diversify, please don‚Äôt shy away from it. Having diverse characters and NPC‚Äôs would only add to immersion. You made bird people and fish people but drew a line at black and brown people? Like...really?\n\nNow, onto the storyline *SPOILERS*\nWhile it‚Äôs too late to make any story changes I feel this important to note. I found that I was never ‚Äúrooting for the home team‚Äù so to speak. There was no attempt at coaxing players into a false sense of security and trust. Once you arrive in white city you learn about the emblems and how the king just kinda..took and/or coerced them away from the civilizations that revered them. It left a bad impression. Akin to how Britain raided sacred items of other cultures to put them in a museum for their own gain. I never wanted to ‚Äúwin‚Äù, I never felt like a hero. I felt like a pawn being used to do someone else‚Äôs dirty work. Which I ultimately was, but had that fact been hidden from me until the climax of the story it would‚Äôve hit harder. But because it wasn‚Äôt kept secret I found myself dragging my feet and not wanting to progress the story because I knew I wasn‚Äôt helping anyone other than the king. There were times where I would‚Äôve preferred to be fighting WITH the bad guys. So much so that I hoped the game was leading up to a ‚Äúchoose your side‚Äù choice but it never came, and so I fought off the dark army with little excitement. \n\nAnyways. Idk how to end this review. The game is pretty, the music is nice especially any trumpet/clarinet parts, but the story left much to be desired. The end",

It certainly isn‚Äôt perfect and I‚Äôll get to that later but the whole game as it‚Äôs self is just great!\n\nA big issue I have with this game that can be an easy fix, is the layout. Being able to change and perfect a layout that suits you would be epic! I constantly find myself trying to shoot enemies and the aim and shoot button feels off, or trying to shield but missing. I known I‚Äôm probably not alone and this could be a huge improvement. Thank you for the good hours I‚Äôve soaked into this brilliant game, I wish I could do it all over.

Plus, while in aim mode I cannot move/dodge/melee attack, so I end up getting hit a couple times before I realize what happened. Please move the aim button up a bit, make it larger (so you can keep your finger on it and still move), and make it so that you have to keep your finger on the button to stay in aim mode. Release the button (or slide your finger off) and it exits aim mode.\n\nI have found myself wanting to drop off a ledge or box, the drop down button appears, I click it and my character climbs back up. Really? Please fix.\n\nThe system used to control followers is clunky. I have to spend way too much time trying to get them to do what I want, making them totally frustrating to use. I hate that I am required to use them for some of the puzzles. Please fix the followers, or remove the requirement to use them in puzzles.\n\nPlease add the ability to zoom in and scroll around the map. Being able to place notes and markers on the map would be a welcome addition.",

The sound track like at the middle of the game when the dark army is here is here the sound track is SAD üòê I mean it really doesn‚Äôt make any sense. And at the end of the game the music gets a little annoying and most of the music is not really advancer like except if you are is a village that‚Äôs fine. My point is music can give a game so much experience to a player and can really tell the story.",

For one thing I definitely love this games layout and open world environment it gives room for grinding and high pay off exploration. While this isn‚Äôt all there is i also like it‚Äôs interface and console level smooth and optimized graphics great for running on iOS. The game is definitely one worth trying out and has a lot of great ways to grind and buildings you can enter as a sort of side quest to test your skill and improve your stats. While the game isn‚Äôt perfect i will definitely acknowledge that it‚Äôs a great title on Apple Arcade and with enough growth and improvements it can definitely make Apple Arcade get better titles. Even so i can‚Äôt totally give this a five star and it has problems. one thing touch control isn‚Äôt the best more often than not your character will freeze up or have trouble moving. Also there‚Äôs always the other bug where your comrades disappear and are not there in though battles. Finally I wish for there to be an update. where your comrades can differentiate bombs from enemies it truly is annoying. How on earth you keep getting killed because you just tried to get one thing and suddenly your killed cause the npcs can‚Äôt tell the difference. Overall while this is my general opinion of the game. Its definitely a good entry game of choice when you wish to kill time and I truly do enjoy it. However to anyone reading this It truly is one game you won‚Äôt regret playing. To the developers keep up the good work and please make improvements as you go on its definitely a game i would recommend to anyone and thank you for making an amazing game.",

Beside that huge & bad thing, one boss fight can easily take 15 minutes, which is reallyjust  too long?? My hand gets sore trying to finish one boss fight and I‚Äôm 22 and have no carpal tunnel or anything so that means it‚Äôs too much. Also I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt really do anything with the map. You can‚Äôt really visit past places easily, it‚Äôs extremely hard to land on an island that you approach .. idk. I feel like they made stuff way harder than it should be and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm probably about to quit because I can‚Äôt beat mesmeroth and I have played several times.

It leads me to a forest tower, that‚Äôs where the nightmare truly starts. \n\nI was first stuck at the closed gate. I had similar experience playing Tomb Raider Anniversary, that is, a game feels hard once not familiar with its pattern. I patiently tried to find this pattern, but no luck. An online guide showed me the way. Ok, good. Go on. Soon enough, I‚Äôm trapped in another room, with no level, not even any interactive object. The companion is silent. Nothing gives any verbal nor visual tip. The online guide shows how to exit the tower, but it clearly is not about this puzzle. The quest description is non-exist. Nothing more than 1 line saying : Meet master Mayfair. It‚Äôs been an agonizing experience for me so far. \n\nIt has good graphics, and very bad storyline that stops a player before he can get a hang of it. Also basically nothing getting you hooked in at least the first hour of gameplay. What‚Äôs worse, no tip at all while riddled with tons of clueless puzzles.",

(even if it was a game based off of another) It had not just held my attention but captured me and many others in a trances with its amazing design and its environmental and verbal storytelling. It was a shining light in the dim garbage dumb that was the Apple store. A main staple of that game which made it so great was that it wasn‚Äôt a purely RPG game. It also included exploration. If you wanted to just go through the main story with the only islands you had to, you could and if you wanted to explore every island the game had to offer, catch every fish, find every spell, every bloodstone, every ghosts skull, you could. The different places you could traverse, the dungeons you could conquer made it so enjoyable and made it fell so big like it actually was an archipelago. I fell like Oceanhorn 2 was smaller and you had less freedom and where you could go and not go was based on your current main story mission. \n\nDevs, I think you should still make more Oceanhorn games make your next game like your first.",

                    "label": "I first played this game about 6 months ago when Apple was promoting the subscription when Apple Arcade got kinda popular. Honestly, I was pretty impressed by the visuals of the trailer and the graphics seemed amazing for a mobile adventure game. It‚Äôs probably inspired by TLoZ, but you can‚Äôt really compare an iOS mobile game to a console video game‚Äî different consoles, graphics, technology, etc. For being one of the first mobile adventure games with a decent storyline, controls, smooth graphics, and nice music... this game revolutionized how mobile gaming could potentially aspire to be on the level of console video games. Now, there are more games like Beyond a Steel Sky that have so much potential and room for growth to expand the genre of mobile adventure games. \n\nIs Oceanhorn the greatest game ever? Probably not, but I can‚Äôt discredit that I did enjoy the game and I want play more. The downfalls of the game were the repetitive-stale missions and the lackluster ending, but going through this game a second time with the recent update has improved the gameplay significantly. I do appreciate the developers for reading reviews and improving the game. This is admirable and is the reason why I re-downloaded the game to see what was updated. Whether it‚Äôs a mobile or video game, what makes a game from being good to great is all about the developers‚Äî there is a lot of potential in Oceanhorn 2 and for future sequels. I look forwards to seeing more from Oceanhorn and the developers. If you‚Äôre thinking about playing this game, give it a shot and just have fun.",

So I'm out of electric shots and it auto saved. I can't continue. I have to run around and scavenge power shots now? That's ridiculous. The puzzle doesn't even seem possible.

I also find that because there‚Äôs no way to recenter yourself (i.e how you can do so in BOTW for Link) it makes your battles more difficult as its easy to lose your opponent. I also wouldn‚Äôt hate a manual button for jumping instead of it being automatic, maybe like a double tap on the left side to jump like you do on the right to roll? I enjoy the concept and graphics of this game immensely however, and I feel with a few tweaks to the controls it could easily become one of my favorites.",
