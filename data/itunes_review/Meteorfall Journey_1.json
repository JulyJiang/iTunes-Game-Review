The main issue that I’m running into is that the alternative characters appear to just be better than the base characters.  However, that means that I end up playing the same deck with the same strategy over and over again.  I’d really like to progress further but I’m already getting a bit bored/frustrated doing the same thing over and over without progression after each characters unlocks.  I would appreciate more unlock able characters that would allow me to try out different archetypes within each class and experiment and try to play a little bit more how I’d like to play.  Lot of fun, but I feel like my stay with this game will be more short lived than it could have because I don’t feel like I can experiment and play how I’d like to.",

Thank you for not making me watch any ads.  Thank you for not having a rapacious paywall.  The graphics are cool and the score is good too.  My only request is more content.  Maybe some sort of new dungeon that opens up after the player beats the game w/each character?  Great job devs!",

The aesthetic is rich with personality and goes well with the simplicity of the game and the funky music. I cannot say enough kind words about this developer or his masterpiece. \n\nAnd even today, so many months after release of a PREMIUM game, it gets FREE updates.

The developer keeps the game updated, too. \n\nI do wish you earned more coins each round so that it would be easier to get rid of weak cards and upgrade good ones, but otherwise the game plays really well and is enjoyable. I do appreciate the fair up-front price and no IAPs, too. \n\nThanks developer for a great game!",

I think the mechanics and overall theme of the game is great, however it lacks the polish I desire for a game that’s about 4 bucks. Some performance problems on my iPhone 6, stutters and lags when loading some card effects. The main problem this game suffers, is simply a lack of more content or areas to progress too. I’d like more choices for character classes, as the standard characters have very set archetypes that are hard to break out of if you want to actually win runs. It’s controls are beautiful and genius for this type of game, however it’s genius is also its downfall, as the lack of choices can leave some games up to complete chance, as some enemies will kill you in one turn because you lack the HP to survive a lucky roll from the opponent. This happens early in the game and later on. A tip for any new players, getting HP early to survive the onslaught while you’re still powering up your deck is a smart choice and sometimes passing on the upgrade is a better choice than trying to go for an ultra powerful deck.  Anyways, great game, highly recommend, just wish there was more content, and a little more polish in regards to the cards visually, and special effects.",

Once you beaten the w/ character once it isn’t terribly fun to replay harder and harder modes w/ no rewards. For me anyway. LOVE that there is alternative characters (well, one right now) to buy with in game currency, need more of those please! As of now I just have a pile of gems burning a hole in pocket w/ nowhere to go. More card variety would be great as well. This game could be really amazing, but at the moment it’s just a fun little time-waster.",

Either this or cards should be included in the scoring. Extra cards can be a huge handicap in score, play (as intended), and money. Thanks for making a cool game.",

It’s fun, you can play it for a few minutes and put it down and pick it up later to finish, or you can play a full game in about 20 minutes.\n\nThe developer clearly loves what he’s doing, and he interacts with players all the time on Reddit and Twitter, and is always open to suggestions for improvement. This is the kind of game - and developer - we should all be supporting, instead of the corporate mobile game companies who are only interested in the bottom line.",

                    "label": "I'll start by saying that I think this game is cool, and one can certainly have fun playing it.  The main problem I have with it is that there often isn't enough information available to the player to allow for tactical decision-making.  Examples:\n-I can't see what cards remain in my deck while taking my turn (if there even is a deck?  There's no obvious shuffling, so it's hard to know how likely I am to get a card at any given point in time).  If I have 4 stamina left (but 3 actions), and I'm trying to decide if I should play a weak-ish card that costs 3 stamina, I need to know how likely it is for my next card to be something I'd rather play\n-I can't see what cards the enemy will be playing (i.e. what's in their deck) or how many cards they'll play per turn, so how am I to know if I should fight a monster or hide when I'm at half health?\n-If a card produces other cards (e.g. curses), there needs to be an explanation of what those cards do when I'm deciding if I should add it to my deck\n-Why do I have to reset the tutorial to get an explanation of how spells and charges work if I didn't happen to pick a class with spells on my first play through?  There should really be a compendium of sorts where one can read up on the rules in case they missed something\n\nLet me finish with saying that I want this game to be better. I hope the developers see this, implement some of the changes that I suggest (or come up with better ideas for how to solve these problems), and this becomes something I'm excited to come back to in the future.",

Well worth the price. \nIt’s a great little time killer with plenty of tension and meaningful decision points. Lots of room for expansions too. Here’s hoping the Dev releases some new content going forward!\nUpdate: I previously had a few minor quibbles about the lack of opportunities to customize the player’s deck in game.  However, after two major updates, this is now one of the best games for IPhone I own and I own a lot. Plenty of opportunities to really hone your deck and build your character. Want to play a fire mage or an ice mage? No problem. A fast, acrobatic thief or a subtle poisoner? Can do. The latest update offers a new, more difficult deck to play against if you so choose and it is FANTASTIC!\nWish list: One more player character and something meaningful on which to spend the in game currency; Players choice of additional starting cards or temporary buffs. Whatever play tests well. \nAmending my previous rating of 4 to 5 stars. This is a GREAT game. Buy it!",

A fun, exciting RPG card battler with exceptional replayability and zero IAP (thank you!) \n\nEach character class offers a very different playstyle, and the random, rougelike elements keep you on your toes in the best way. \n\nA couple nits hold things back slightly. Playthroughs offer gems that can be used to unlock new starting cards. A lean deck is vital to successful runs and there is no option to remove unlocked cards from your starting decks. As a result, you can end up crippling your decks by “unlocking” subpar cards (don’t do it!), which *should be a reward. This definitely needs a tweak. \n\nI also think endgame balancing needs a slight tweak. I like how you can get surprised and die in almost any match if you’re caught off guard or get unlucky, but the final two bosses are a bit OP, and can seemingly only be defeated with very specific builds (and major RNG luck) - which limits exploration and variety a bit. \n\nThose quibbles aside though, this is a phenomenal effort from a small developer and definitely worth the buy. I’ve gotten hours for pennies from this purchase.",

However, these can appear at the same time in a run, making them mutually exclusive (at that juncture, at least). \n\nThis problem is compounded by the fact that there is (of course) a finite number of appearances of the Temple/Blacksmith in each run, and furthermore—as other reviewers have noted—some starting cards in each deck that are worthless and must be removed. Then there’s the fact that upon leveling up, the game will sometimes force you to add unwanted cards to your deck which will ultimately have to be removed as well. Simply put: luck plays a stronger role than is warranted.",
