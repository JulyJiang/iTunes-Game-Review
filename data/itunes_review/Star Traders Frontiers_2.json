If you didn‚Äôt get caught, why are people bashing you!?\n3- further stat distance between ship upgrades. \nWhy bother to buy anything but the best weapons/armor? They‚Äôre comparatively cheap. \n4-allowing story characters that come aboard to change into your ship‚Äôs uniform. \n5- missions to get ‚Äúlevel 11‚Äù gear, explicitly. \n6- ships that don‚Äôt require mass dampeners to exist. It‚Äôs annoying to have them there, although I understand the usefulness at times. \n7- if you carry an edict, and you‚Äôre doing legal work for a prince, I don‚Äôt think you should be concerned about rep loss, maybe that goes along with ‚Äúgetting caught‚Äù. \nI have other ideas to make the game a bit more interesting, but those are the big ones. \nEagerly awaiting the ability to rank my character past level 40!",

You manage a ship and crew, being able to equip and upgrade ships and develop the skills of your crew (which is large) in considerable detail. \n\nMissions are convoluted, the back story is rich, and you have choices everywhere. E.g. you can not only pick missions and decide what approach to take at every juncture but the impact of your crew and their skills is explicit. \n\nSpace combat is a bit disappointing (so far). It‚Äôs turn based and you basically click buttons and watch numbers go by. That said I‚Äôve not gotten far and the mechanics have a lot of depth so it may grow on me.",

The learning curve isn‚Äôt that bad, but once you learn the menus, it‚Äôs all gravy. It‚Äôs surprisingly complex for a mobile game; for instance, I had no idea you could equip your captain, officers, and crew with items until a contact offered to sell me military equipment. Fantastic game! Trading is easy and fun: once you land on a planet you can look them up in the Atlas and see what items they sell or buy, and see if their prices are better or worse then others in the system. No regrets here! Thank you Trese Brothers for making a great game!",

Good storyline (but could be expanded, particularly late-game, I think), but there‚Äôs one thing that I think could improve the game. With ship combat, I think it would be interesting to have multiple ships available in the same battle. Sort of like convoy tactics, where a merchant may be protected by a couple cruisers or a carrier plus a battle cruiser, just opening up more specialized ships and more battle options. But again, great game, just something I think could be implemented.",

The narrative elements that are in the game are interesting. \n\nBut the narrative experience is a bit hollow and the world is devoid of charm. There‚Äôs not much to really grind towards - no bases to build, fleets to run, and the allies you make are little more than glorified fetch-quest givers - though that‚Äôs all you‚Äôll be doing. The difficulty is also wonky, you‚Äôll quickly be hunted by other factions unless you play extremely neutral (which is all but impossible) and on bigger maps this makes getting around a real pain in the rear. \n\nThe game has a lot of potential, I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes.

Then the contact and faction system is just woah(can‚Äôt even put into words atm). Every choice felt like it mattered and it also felt like the galaxy changed around me from those choices. This game is truly a diamond in the rough for mobile Gamers and is highly recommend it, if you like rpgs this game is for you. I‚Äôll see you among the stars traders. Another plus is the fact that the developers are constantly communicating and updating the game.

Now I am hooked!!!\n\nI was impressed with the HoS storyline development, blown away with ST! This is my favorite game on my phone by far. Short bursts or for a long space session, this game has crazy amount of replay possibilities. Wow, just wow! Amazing work Brothers!!!",

I‚Äôve had it for a few days and can‚Äôt stop playing it.\n\nThe story I‚Äôve only dipped into but it‚Äôs clear player choice matters and is core to the game. There is a infinite amount of depth but I chose a custom difficulty this first play through to get acquainted. You could just stay at an easy difficulty and just play the game for the story and as a progression rpg or play something as hard as FTL while managing the complexity of EVE online. \n\nLike I said been a few days but this might become my all time favorite game on iPhone.

This is still the same dense set of RPG systems that the Trese brothers have been developing for years as far as I can tell, but now it‚Äôs been refined and expanded upon, and put in a fresh new wrapper. You are free to engage with the narrative as much as you desire, and it is well written, though you can strike out on your own and leave the narrative behind at any time. The only thing I can complain about here is that sometimes the mission descriptions don‚Äôt seem to mention the correct location, through they do allow you to navigate to the next mission waypoint directly from the mission dialogue.",
