The horrendous AI makes this game a challenge. A challenge is nice but the AI just frustrates me. Carrying 5 resource blocks to a constriction site that only requires one wastes the precious time that you have or don’t between attacks. The rest of the game is a charm. The Textris like strategy style makes each game feel different from the last, and it has you thinking of how you can make the entire system more efficient with different layouts. Yet, there are two things that cripple the game from a full 5 stars and a “perfect” experience:\n\n1. The AI. Like I already said, the AI is just terrible. They sometimes go to the furthest research site when it is near another one. And the construction often take way longer than it had to be. \n2. No adjustment options. Adding some options of like how long the time between each attacks could compensate for the bad AI. Or it could be use to be made to be more challenging. Both of which adds to the replayability. And adding the option of how many minions you star with would also be great. Along with the option of resources required to build something. \n\nBut in the end, games like this (immensly successful) usually don’t get much care from developers. But I hope it gets updated in the future.",

I've hit level 32, it just takes thought and planning.\n\nThe pace, progression, and flow of the game are spot on. \n\nEven the much maligned AI is fine once you figure out how it makes its decisions (go for the most in-need resource, via the shortest path. On weapon runs, fill to the nearest - in the order of orders given,) it's predictable and something you can plan around.\n\nOh, and for the people saying you just have to leave minions in the weapons rooms at higher levels: design your bases better. There's plenty of safe work for minons to do in a well-surrounded core. Even better, it's work without a timer - free labor.\n\nThe only this I'm really craving is more scenarios and challenges.

                    "label": "This is actually an easy game, once you figure it out (and by the comments not many do). It's all about productivity, how fast you can farm and how fast you can make new minions. Making the right rooms close together, the right order of monoliths to research, the right moment to start the defenses, it all makes a lot of difference at the end and take time to master.\n\nAt the present moment my best attempt was 32 waves, in 69 minutes. I had more than 50 minions, my device crashed a few times thanks to that! Hehe.\n\nTo those having issues I suggest to start making the minimum, then start to produce minions, once you got some idle, start making more kitchens and gardens to make MORE minions. Do the other constructions and the research with the extra minions while the first ones are making more and more of them. Make sure to construct the defenses around the center of minion production, don't be afraid of keeping some minions there all the time. And there should always be minions making minions even in attacks (after you have like 10 of them), they are protected inside the center while the other are defending the frontier. Losing a couple minions is not as bad as losing production time. Make minions, lots of it!!! \n\nAbout the minion AI, there's a few annoying things, like they often do the exactly same task and when one completes it they all drop it and go to the same one again next. It's hilarious to see 30 minions all carrying food to the same quarter that can only receive 4 of it. Although that's annoying, if you put a cap, you may end up with a task stuck with the most far minion just because he was the first one to be idle.\nFunny enough that's exactly what happens when you call minions to arms, the first one you drag will pick the closest to him, and so on, the last ones will have to take what is left, and sometimes what's left is in the whole other side of the map. \nIf you change it, you'll end up with lots of minions running to the same weapon, just to realize it's full and lots of minions running to another one and so on. That would be even worse and completely uncontrollable.\nThe AI is actually perfect, you just need to know HOW to deal with it. Here's how: 1. Make clusters of kitchen, garden and quarters, so minions don't travel much, they'll stay in that same area. 2. Make the weapons in the outside, around that center of minion production. 3. When calling for an attack, first drag the minion doing research (since they are the most far away), then constructors (that usually are all over the place) and then the farmers and cookers (that are suppose to be all in the middle of the map and equally close to all weapons). \n\nThe minion don't ignore an empty room, is just that that room is already taken by a minion you called to arms first. You can't expect the game to recalculate the paths and weapons they'll take every time you put more minion on weapons duty, you'll end up with lots of minions changing paths all the time. \nWhat could be implemented is a \"all to weapons\" button, that way all the minions would be calculated at same time and with the best outcome. And after it was done you could hit it again and they all would go back to their exactly jobs before. That would be handy.\n\nTo devs, give more challenges! :D",

This is a major flaw that could be solved if the developer made the game into a more puzzle strategy archetype with levels, changing goals and maps, rather than a repetitive sprint to level 16, at which point waves come to fast for you to even regenerate troops, let alone actually expand on infrastructure and decode monoliths.

It features simplistic yet strategic gameplay, paired up with great visuals and an overall artistic appeal. However, there is one thing that heavily detracts from the game's playability- the minion AI. \nMinions are your workers, who build units, man them(notably weapons,which are crucial to your survival) and research monoliths-one of the primary goals of the game. However, their movement and pathfinders mechanics ignore the most logical options to perform the required task. This hits hard when you need to man your weapon and defend against waves of attackers. Minions will just randomly choose a room, regardless of its proximity- sometimes, minions will go to the other side of the map, ignoring much closer options that they pass along the way. The AI's infuriatingly incompetent path finding has frequently resulted in defeat; losses that easily could have been avoided if it was a better system. Despite this, the game is still quite fun- as long as the pathfinding program doesn't screw you over...",

UNTIL I got to ~wave 20 from where on you can't practically do anything anymore but have all your minions in the weapons room and hope it goes well. Which it doesnt for very long.\n\nAlso, minions are STUPID. The AI and wayfinding is really a bad joke.\n\nThis could be one of my favourite games on iOS and a rock solid 5 Stars IF you work on the AI and give me something like a relaxed mode where attacks dont speed up and I can focus on base-building.\n\nUPDATE: Sorry, after playing some more, I have to downgrade to ONE star. The reason is this useless, crappy, worthless, unbearable AI.\nWHY do they run by empty weapons rooms instead of just going in?\nIf I continue researching after a wave, WHY dont the minions in the weapons room right next to it go there, but some random ones from far far away ???\n\nThis feels like an alpha preview, NOT a finished game.\nWill stop playing until this is resolved.\n\nUpdate: For two years now, no update, not a peep. They just took our money and ran. Big BOOO! And I will NEVER buy any of your apps again.\n\nUpdate: After AGES, finally an update. Minions are as unforgivingly stupid as ever, which was the main flaw with this game. Total FAIL, you guys should just not try to make games if you are not up to it.",

The clock for the attackers shortens every wave which at around wave 25 it's almost impossible to gather a single resource before the stupid buzzer goes off. This is a HUGE FLAW!! The clock for each wave should stay the same . Come on developers how could you screw that up? Needs more gameplay ideas like a seperate mission mode, multiplayer mode, and overall design world mode to just play with the building aspects and not have to worry about incoming attacks. \n\nWhat needs to be done:\n\n1- take out shortened wave cycles and just have the difficulty increase by the number of attackers per wave. \n2- add missions\n3-multiplayer, 1vs1, 4vs4. Or have worlds of multiplayer maps which can hold 50 or 100 players on a very large grid for which to build bases and what not.\n4- change the name of the game to attract more players.\n\nUntil updates are made this game is not worth any money .",
