Once you go into the equipment change option not only can I not change the equipment there isn’t even a way to get out of that option. If you want to continue playing you have to turn off the app and start the mission without changing your equipment. Also, doubling tapping to move your troops is not very sensitive. You either have to zoom in to do It or try several times which is super annoying. I have a feeling there are more bugs and issues in this app I just haven’t discovered it yet as the app feels very clunky to operate. This game will be very unpleasant to play until these issues are fixed. Please fix right away!",

However I believe iOS is a close 2nd compared to the other console versions. The load times are almost not there where as on my Xbox I would be waiting 2 minutes to start a mission. And the controls for touch screen are amazing, definitely prefer them over a game pad. And don’t listen to everyone complaining about the double tap to move being difficult. There is a setting you can turn on that will place a “move” button on the screen. Overall blown away at how well it runs and very happy with my 5th purchase of this amazing game. My only gripe however is I have been unable to find a “make all utility items available button” on the dispatch screen. Maybe I’m just dumb and can’t figure it out but if that’s my only complaint then that should tell you how great this port is.",

                    "label": "When I saw this game coming to iPad I could hardly believe it. I bought a gaming PC specifically to play this game when it originally released in 2016. The fact it now runs on my 2018 iPad Pro 11” makes me very happy and blows my mind. Occasionally makes me giddy. I’ve got about 20 hours logged on it now. I’m confident in saying it runs on my iPad just as well as it does on console and aforementioned gaming PC with the compromise of low res textures, but not as low as I would have expected! Looks much better than the switch version. I also really appreciate the UI design to accommodate the touch screens. I’d love the option to adjust the size of it as it seems a tad big on iPad, but is very well designed. I also appreciate the quality of life improvements the developers incorporated into the UI. Many of which are clearly inspired by mods commonly used on the PC version. Thank you so much for including them here!  As far as the port goes, I’m am very impressed and delighted. Thank you so much for making one of my all time favorite games even more accessible to me!\n\nFor those who have never played the game before, prepare for a wonderful abusive relationship. This game is very difficult, but fair. You will always know why you lost and come back for more. Watching your friends and co-workers die at the hands of evil alien overlords on procedurally generated maps in campaigns that last 20 to 70 hours that never play the same. It’s glorious. And is still my favorite game since 2016. Don’t worry if you haven’t played the first game. This game assumes you failed to repel the invasion almost immediately in its predecessor. Just hop in and play. XCOM story is interesting, but the very best stories are the ones you create in between those beats.",

Otherwise, this game is totally worth it!\n\nOf note, it didn’t use an inordinate amount of battery to play, and my phone never got hot.

I was very surprised to see it in the store a couple of weeks ago! I was a bit hesitant to buy it because I wasn’t sure how closely it would match the PC version which I have, but besides some lower graphics which is obviously expected, it is extremely close to an exact port of the PC version. Sure there are a few bugs here and there, but that is to be expected at release. I haven’t gotten very far into the game yet, but I am extremely impressed so far! Keep up the good work Dev team!",
