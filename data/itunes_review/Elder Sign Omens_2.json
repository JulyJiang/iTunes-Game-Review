                    "label": "I love Elder Sign. The board game is excellent & I think the app is great, but my biggest problem lies with the fact that it often feels like this game cheats. Yes, poor choices often result in losses, and a good strategy will help, but I've managed to lose on \"easy\" cards despite having more than enough clue tokens & items to reasonably beat it. It feels like after a certain amount of successes, you will automatically fail on 1 or 2 adventures. On some of the harder cards, it feels like you need to sacrifice investigators & items before being able to pass it. The curator is arguably the most ridiculously adventure in the game. I've had to beat some cards with 4 Investigators, but that's the one card where I've had all 4, had a very well equipped Joe Diamond (with 5 clues aka 10 rerolls) and still lost! I don't know what kind of algorithm the game uses to determine successes & failures, but it feels as if FFG deliberately stacked the deck highly against the player. Considering that I have full control of my rolls in the Board game version & fail considerably less, it's hard not to feel like the game cheats. I still enjoy the app, but some days it feels like a trial in patience. It's why I typically end up playing the board game version instead. At least I can control my own dice roll. Either way, if you can get past the notion that the game cheats and are willing to deal with many losses before beating the harder AO's, this game is still a good way to kill some time, or play ES without having to set and clean up.",

The user interface is often confusing. Misclicks happen often with no way to undo them. There are too many cinematic transitions that arbitrarily lengthen game time. There's a transistion in between basically anything that could possibly happen and anything after that. It's borderline ridiculous. The game is slightly different as in the board game you don't auto lose when the doom track fills up. Also, I really do feel this is harder than the board game. I only lose on the table about 25% of the time over many playthroughs both solo and teaching new people. I've beaten this once. The discrepancy is too big for me to assume it's just bad luck. If you don't want the physical version (which isn't that expensive) and just need to play this, it's serviceable. But it's not for me.",

Most symbols have only a 1:6 chance of coming up on any glyph conjure (roll). If you need multiples of those glyphs, your unlikely to statistically get them unless you're using the abilities of the investigators to lock glyphs or re-roll a few times. Just read/watch the help menu. Attempt to play (and lose) a scenario and you'll have a pretty good sense of the strategy of the game. Not as tight as some other cooperative games I've played, but a decent level of challenge not regretting picking it up.",

There are a few nuances, but if you can make some tough decisions, the game is certainly beatable. I beat all four of the starting Old Ones (Yig and Hastur on my first try), and I'm on to Cthulhu.\n\nIt's a dice game where you pick characters based on their perks, and beat challenges while accruing loot and sealing away the \"big bad\". Meanwhile, the \"big bad\" is throwing in monsters to make the challenges more difficult, and opening portals to other worlds. Some challenges need to be nipped in the bud before things get out of hand (especially the ones with \"midnight effects\"), and it's YOUR job to manage the risk, bonuses, and livelihood of your party. You also get \"trophy points\" for beating these challenges, which can be used at the entrance to buy more bonuese, or recover health. It certainly not easy, but the game throws you bone often enough.\n\nWith all due respect, seeing these other reviews saying \"the dice are rigged\" is beyond disappointing - the tutorial tells you what the odds on the dice (or \"glyphs\", whatever) are! If the odds are something other than what that tutorial claims, I'd be shocked. I've had plenty of fun, and challenges, with no issues.",

You don't have full access to everything the board game has, mainly it's missing Blessings/Curses and Allies. Makes it more challenging. \n\nIn app purchases are cheap, and you get a ton of stuff. I will definitely be doing those purchases in the future. \n\nAll in all this app in my opinion is worth the $3.00 for the base. (Add $9.00 to get the other 3 in app expansions).",

However, a $10 investment demands more features, the first being asynchronous multiplayer. The board game is for 1-8 players, and there's simply no reason this digital version should be single-player only. It also needs Game Center support. You get a score at the end of the game, why no online leaderboard? Lastly, for a game this size (and price), iCloud saving should be a gimme. \n\nGive me those things, and this game will be right on the money (and 5-stars).",

This is a fantastic digital recreation of one of the best card games out there.  Several other reviews touched on the main points that make the game great so I will skip those to address things that may help people on the fence decide.  First off this game is great for multiplayer!  Simply pick your investigators and pass the device when your turn is up.  It works great in this capacity.  Secondly this game is a lot of strategy requiring a bit of luck.  What I mean by this is you have to play to your investigator's strengths and abilities.  You can't just send them off to any adventure and expect to win.  Set yourself up for success by combining your abilities with your current items to tackle each adventure.  Thirdly, you will die.  A lot.  Sometimes the stars just don't align properly, the dice fall short, and you fail even when you set yourself up for success.  This is the nature of board games and in this board game the deck is stacked against you.  Remember it's you vs the game, not the other players.\n\nEdit:  the expansions are totally worth the money.  They take the board game beyond what is currently available.",

                    "label": "I wish Omens kept statistics so I could tell you how many times it's destroyed me. Having started dozens of games, I think I've won three or four times, tops. That's the kind of game Elder Sign is: it does take prisoners, but it shoves them raving in an asylum cell, never to see the sun again.\n\nElder Sign has almost inconceivably high production values. The amount, variety and quality of the artwork is incredible. The game looks and sounds fantastic, and the little Mythos one-liners on tasks help focus the mood. The later DLC campaigns even allow for multiple outcomes to the game (or so I hear; I've never finished most if them). For a late-night haunted museum simulator, it's top tier.\n\nOmens' one problem is that in many ways it...isn't a game. Conflict resolution is managed by rolling a handful of dice and matching them against a series of ordered requirements, thus completing tasks. Some active tasks can have consequences, inflicting punishments at midnight or even locking part of your hand of dice. While characters do have special abilities, most of your decisions in the game are the decision to use or save various items that increase the number of dice you have to roll or allow rerolls. As a gameplay interaction mechanic, it's weak, and you'll constantly feel at the mercy of the brutal dice gods as near-impossible tasks prove...near impossible and that beast probability destroys you even on simple tasks. The randomness can be boring at best and hugely frustrating at worst. The question of whether Omens can even count as a \"game\" when randomness is the most important factor is debatable, and some people will doubtless not be able to hold their attention on the task.\n\nIn spite of that, Elder Sign is weirdly enthralling. Failure is a tradition of Cthulhu Mythos stories, so it's not too surprising when most forays end in the end of the world. There's something very right about a certain amount of downer in a Mythos game, and the art and sense of urgency do a lot to keep the player involved even when he realistically has very little agency. Yeah, Bluetooth multiplayer wouldn't go amiss, but it's hard to know how badly such a protracted game requires online play. All in all, if you're a Mythos fan and don't mind frequent and sometimes highly random failure, you should drop a few dollars on Omens, and maybe pick up some of the weirder expansions, too. You've got nothing to lose but your mind.",

Well, you won't see any more money from me...\n\nUpdate: The game is still fun but now I see some issues. Hence the review update. First, no iCloud support (or any other online storing function). Not cool FFG! Also, if I want to play it on my iPad I have to buy it again (which I refuse to do so). Don't be greedy FFG and make this a universal app! Lastly, this new monster appearance mechanic is plain ugly. What was wrong with the old one?! \n\nOriginal: This is simply a great game, requiring a lot of strategy (even though throwing dice is random, you can cleverly tip the scale to your favor with skills, items, and some general thinking). It is fun, and looks really nice. What else would you need? Also, with this latest Cthulhu expansion the challenge went up considerably, which is a welcome addition as the base game was kind of easy. I cannot recommend Elder Sign enough.",

Plus, careful planning goes a long way.\n\nThat said, a really fun game, and I can't gush enough about the beautiful Lovecraft-inspired artwork.\n\nThe DLC is a bit expensive, but with so much love put into the artwork, it's easy to understand why. For fans of Lovecraft and dice games, this one's a must!",

I love the graphics, audio and the game play however the game even if played with the most logical decision making to increase your chances of winning is done, the odds of winning is low because too many penalty monsters are dealt out at the end of most rounds.  One round my players were penalized with 8 monsters.  Also the special skills players are granted do not consistently work - needs fixing.  I have beaten the first two monsters but the last 3 I have not come close.  The twist on the adventure to Alaska is fun but also pretty impossible to win.  If you don't mind losing frequently and just love playing than I recommend this package.  FYI - all three games takes up a lot of memory as far as apps go.",

Cthulhu is at least less fickle.\n\nIt's a beautiful game and has a great story with it, but the game mechanic is based completely on a random number generator (RNG). So strategy and careful planning are useless as everything is a roll of the die.\n\nSo you can complete several tough adventures in a row, all because the dice roll just the way you needed them to do. Only to fail on a simple one, because the dice failed to give the one thing that you really needed.\n\nAnd once you start to fail adventures you tend to continue to fail. When you complete an adventure you can get items that allow you to modify die rolls, get more dice to roll, heal and so on. But each item is discarded once used, so losing an adventure means you don't get to replace any used items. And so you get weaker. A character can take a turn to heal or buy a new item, but taking a turn to do so is gamble as you can only do one thing. And the longer the game continues the harder the adventures can get. So it's easy to find yourself in an unwinable situation.\n\nUnless, of course, you get really lucky on the dice rolls. Just ignore that fact that relying on a roll of the dice got you into this situation.",
