(I don’t think they’re new I was just a kid back when it was released on PC) \n\nI will admit, it’s a bit easier to navigate on my iPad, the iPhone screen is kind of small when placing things on the grid. But still playable. \n\nIt’s absolutely worth the price of the app, and I highly recommend. If you liked the original, you’ll probably like this.",

                    "label": "I love this game and have become addicted to it again. There is a few issues I see. When I ride breaks down and your mechanic goes to try and fix it there has been (4 times for me) a guest who is frozen in the entrance of the ride which means your mechanic can’t get in there to fix the ride. I’ve tried clicking on the guest and moving them but nothing happens. I’ve tried just about everything I can think of to fix the problem. No matter if you exit the game and go back in. Save it and go back in the guest is always still frozen in the entrance of the ride which again prevents the mechanic from being able to fix it. The only solution I’ve come up with is I have to trash the ride and re build it which is too much work to have to keep doing every time it happens. The only other issue I have come across is your janitors who sweep the paths. No matter how many you hire no matter if you give them specific jobs to do. You can have 10 janitors assigned to the same area and your guest will ALWAYS complain about the disgusting state of your path. There is one park on here I didn’t pass because guests always complain about my paths. I had 50 janitors hires and had 15 assigned to one part of the park that was the dirtiest. I would watch what they were doing and they would all walk by the piece of trash on the ground AND walk outside of there assigned areas. The only way they would sweep it up is if I picked them up and placed them on top of the spot that was dirty. Kinda a lot to do when your building a park. If these problems were fixed I wouldn’t have any issue giving this game 5 stars",

Well worth the cost for this app. There are a few bugs though, but nothing terrible enough to make it unplayable.

When I first got the game, it was free, then I went to get on a friends device and it said to pay. Idk why maybe it was free for some time then became money costing. Idk but I’m still kinda upset.

When I found this was finally out on iOS so I could relive some great memories, I found that this is in fact not the classic. This is a combination of RCT and RCT2. There’s nothing really wrong with that as RCT2 added some great visuals and extra little things, but the thing I did not like about RCT2 is that it would block you from doing certain things that were possible in the classic RCT such as entrance fee. I get this may be part of a scenario in some instances, but if it isn’t explicitly for the scenario, we should still be able to have the option of doing an entrance fee instead of it being blocked.\n\nOverall, I love this game and happy to be able to play it again, but I would rather have the RCT classic the way it was than having a blend. At the very least if there is going to be a blend, then perhaps just pull in some of the coaster designs or graphics from the RCT2 but keep the functionality the same as RCT classic.",

Let’s take everything good about the franchise and switch it out for a pay to play bailout for atari. NO. BAD ATARI. THIS IS WHY YOU WENT BANKRUPT. PAC-MAN WORLD3 WAS A MISTAKE!\n\nThen they wised up and did the simplest thing in the world. They ported RCT1&2 to mobile and charged $6. I would have been happy to pay $20 for it. Thank you Atari.\n\nOnly complaints-\nFirst complaint. the game ignores the curved edges on the new iPhones and makes pressing buttons hard. Have to rotate the phone to get stuff done. \nSecond complaint. There is a bug with some rollercoasters and the more you rebuild them the lower the excitement rating drops, which isn’t a problem in most scenarios, but impossible when you are playing the partially built coaster scenarios.",

                    "label": "If you are looking for the classic RCT game you have found it!!! It’s almost identical to the PC version. There are a few differences. \n\nPROS\n\n-When you build the walking paths or the queue lines, if there is a tree in the way you can build on it and it will automatically remove the tree, whereas in the pc game it says “tree in the way.”\n\n-The rides and food places have dollar amounts pop up every time something is sold, giving you a much better idea of what’s selling and what’s not.\n\n-The rides give you an option to “include scenery” so if you want your ride decorated and already have a queue lines and exit paths attached you can, but it will cost more to build that way. But you can also turn it off if you’d like to make it cheaper.\n\nCONS\n\n-I am playing it on my iPhone 8, so because of that the buttons are REALLY small and you may tap the wrong thing sometimes. It’s a little tough to place your handymen, guards, mechanics, and entertainers. A stylus would be recommended if you are playing on a phone to make it a bit easier!\n\n-You can’t charge an entrance fee for your park, it’s free to get in. But to counter that, in this version you can just make the rides, food, etc a lot more expensive than you normally would in the PC version but the customers won’t complain about it (unless you make it WAY too high) As an example I charged $10 for a ride on the Crazy Caterpillar coaster. Queue line stayed full! \n\nAll things considered I would highly recommend this game and it’s totally worth the $6!!",

This game isn’t perfect on mobile (no update for the newer phones so it is cropped out but I play this on an iPad) and you have to pay extra to download parks and rides created by people (such as the useful rides from the Marcel Vos guides). But besides that, this is a great real game to play on your phone or iPad and sink hours into.",

I try other games, so many different games, but I never find myself wanting to go back to them after a few sessions. This game is different. I’ve paid far bigger money for console games that I don’t spend nearly as much time on or get nearly as much enjoyment, relaxation, and satisfaction from. And for a tablet game I absolutely love not having ads or timer countdown locks on features. Extremely worth it to pay the money (such a small amount too compared to the combo of original pc software it contains) and get a complete game free of ad and pay to win hell. Thanks again to the rtc team for making this awesome game and bringing it life again in a new format.",

I have been a fan of it since it came out on PC (RCT3 is just okay. There is some kind of magic to be had in RCT, RCT2, and this one, essentially both combined.) You manage a park with finances, simply put. Game has multiple “scenarios” that require you to perform certain tasks in order to win - quite fun and interesting.\nMy biggest beef lately is that on the new curved iPhone screens, and especially the “null zone” near the top of the screen where the camera etc are are essentially ignored by the game. This makes selecting the “Adjust Land” option, the “Settings” option a repetitious endeavor, and spoiler: both of these are very useful and will be pressed FREQUENTLY...or at least, you will try to. The park info button in the top left is hard to press as well, but not used as frequently. Park map in top right is big enough that it is not an issue. But the other corners...and my eyes brightened when this just got a new update..!! But alas..these issues ignored.\nAm I trying to deter you? Not at all. Great game, but unfortunately, probably more suited for anything less than the newest phone, or on an iPad, which to me kind of alienates a big group of players, myself included.\nI will be waiting for the day I can complete the scenarios on my phone. Until that time, ride and scream, friends.",
