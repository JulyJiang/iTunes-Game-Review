                    "label": "Normally I HATE these types of games. Maybe because it‚Äôs warhammer I actually have the patience for one of them this time, my only real complaint is that I completed one of the warpstone challenges by filling in my email as the conditions said, but I haven‚Äôt received any warpstone. I‚Äôm worried that if I do the warpstone challenges that gives me five thousand for donating to a wildlife preservation effort it‚Äôll jip me again.\n\nAlso: Alliance coins are great, and they open a lot of avenues. But shields, invigorating drafts, and warlord xp should NOT be more than 20,000. That‚Äôs kind of outrageous, the same goes for warlord honours. None of them really affect the tier level of your troops so it doesn‚Äôt really do much for your advancement, shields should just be more easily accessible anyway, and a warlord honour shouldn‚Äôt be 2,500 for ONE of them. This game is great but it could use a bit of improvement, \n\nWhat really has me shocked is long list of entertaining mechanics this game has that I‚Äôm not going to write down because I took too long writing this review already. The only way I could see this game being more fun is if we got cutsecenes for our warlords taking on foes or our troops taking on enemy armies. Including enemy player armies. Keep up the good work!",

I wish there was a little more action, like actual battles you could view, or at least the champion fights. But it‚Äôs really just a numerical strategy game with a nice skin. Still fun though. \n\nMy biggest issue with the game is the sponsored ads you use to get in game currency. I clicked on one that had an astronomically high amount, it was a link to an online wine shop. You had to sign up and make a purchase, so I did. I figured, if I was going to spend money to get digital currency, I might as well get some wine.  I signed up, for the confirmation email, made a purchase, got the email, waited.... waited.... I could make a claim ticket for 24 hours, so I waited some more. Submitted my claim ticket with a screenshot of my purchase email. \n\nThey responded and said I didn‚Äôt do what I was supposed to do to complete the ad and asked for proof that I had. I already sent them the screenshot of my purchase, so I sent another screen shot of my welcome to Winc email to show I had subscribed. Now I‚Äôm sitting here waiting for a response. \n\nJust don‚Äôt use any of their click bait and you should be fine. The games good enough, but I‚Äôm not happy that they got me to sign up for a $40 a month wine club and didn‚Äôt give me my credit... which is just a valueless in game currency that they could have easily just said, ‚Äúoh, looks like something went wrong. Oh well, here you go (click)‚Äù and made a happy consumer. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

The idea behind it was solid, there are some amazing people who play, and some of the events and challenges are great taking more than just a point and destroy mode of game play unlike a lot of games in this genre.\n    Now to the crux of the one star rating. The game is set up in such a way that if you play, to really succeed you have to hope to get brought into whichever realm you wind up ins most powerful alliance if not be prepared to stay low level for awhile. Of course as is the design of these games you can spend real world money, but even that is no guarantee of success. This game is geared to cater to the largest alliance. You spend months and months building up to get caught up in an angry temper tantrum by someone in the two or three strongest alliances and you can no longer even go to get the resources you need to get larger or stronger and to even heal the soldiers you lost trying to get your resources so you can‚Äôt even heal them to continue trying to grow.\n   Hope that you don‚Äôt get caught with a lower shield because even though you have ‚Äúdefenses‚Äù a player one level above you in the strongest alliance will cut straight through your defenses that you have spent months building up, and kill all your troops. Now you have no troops to send out, if they didn‚Äôt get attacked on the gathering trip, no resources to heal with and you permanently lose some in the process. All while you are just trying to play the games normal challenges of fighting the monster armies or empire armies. Your alliance members can‚Äôt help because they are having to heal and save themselves. The idea of creating a system that allows one or two alliances to dictate how every other player can or can‚Äôt play is beyond ridiculous.\n   The developers are constantly commenting oh how can we improve or fix these problems, but no real action is being taken. Many people have offered some great ideas, such as adjusting how much offense you can use to attack another weaker player. Adjusting the attack versus defense dynamic. Make the game more focused on the challenges outside of the internal player battles. Using the other regions as a leveling system, if this was put into play a lot of these players who have their regions under their thumbs would have to prove how good they really are when everyone is at the same level. \n   In conclusion this game began as a calming, fun, and believe it or not a brain stimulating game. However it turned into a disastrous experience that I threw way too much money into because I kept thinking if I get stronger the game will be more fair. The truth is it never would have. I wish I had that money back to put into my actual Warhammer models, as at least if I lose a match with them I don‚Äôt literally watch hundreds of dollars and months of time be cast away in the blink of an eye. I know I have rambled on for far to long but this game received a lot of my heart and time and a part of me hopes to either see an actual change take place and the game be fixed, or to save someone else from the waste of time and money that will come from playing this game. If you don‚Äôt believe me open the game up and look around at all the dead fortresses and ask why are so many people that download this game leaving en mass. Hope this review helps someone, cheers!",

Most games similar to this (even the really crappy ones) have already fully optimized their game to take advantage of the screens real estate. Please update, will def change my score.",

                    "label": "Seriously, what is with these games and the pay to play BS. I love the game, it gets 5 stars for being fun... until you have to open your wallet. Sure, you CAN play for free, but you‚Äôll always get dumped on by anyone who puts money into the game and has a basic understanding of how combat works.\n\nI get it, money makes the world go ‚Äòround, but with successful games like fortnite which has no pay to win features, only aesthetics, they STILL take in a significant amount of cash. Why ruin your player base and leave the game to be ruled by the insignificant amount of whales out there when you already have a huge amount of fans for this franchise that you can milk for years to come? You really f‚Äôd the pooch on this game and your marketing.\n\nThe games mechanics are fun to work out and the game has a decent amount of things going on to keep players busy. It is reminiscent of the total war games and /can/ be quite entertaining. The major downfall is the fact that I constantly feel like it‚Äôs a game between me and my wallet, and it ruins the fun. I don‚Äôt eagerly await new upgrades that I can just pay for, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun facing the anxiety of losing troops that I‚Äôve paid real money for, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun to feel like I need to spend money to switch between fighting, building troops, or gathering resources. I don‚Äôt think it is fun to feel like I need to spend money to engage in combat (buying tps so I can hit someone before they throw up a shield to stop an attack). I don‚Äôt think it is fun to wait 2 months to unlock a unit that other people who just happen to have a larger amount of expendable income have unlocked weeks ago. I don‚Äôt think it is fun feeling like I have no chance to compete for the super cool cities and buffs because the majority of the power on the server is held by 3-5 people all in the same alliance. \n\nSeriously, this game had potential to be a long time earner for this company, it already has an established fan base, the game systems are interesting, specifically the mix of pve and pvp aspects... but you end up having large numbers of players who start playing, then quit because they get screwed over by people who drop money in the game. Then, without those players, you‚Äôre left with a large amount of people who are either very committed to the franchise and are just there to be farmed, or people who have spent a s‚Äî load of money, and no consistent middle ground for your casual players.\n\nI am not going to lie. I spent way more money on this game than I should have. I don‚Äôt feel like it has the longevity of other games, and I also felt compelled to keep up with the Jones‚Äô. I probably will keep playing simply because of the sunk cost, and just that makes me sick to my stomach. \n\nI am also anticipating a large number of hackers breaking the game following the release on steam, mostly because I know that people would rather hack something like this than pay money into it. The fact that it is pay to win will also make it harder to identify who is hacking because people will just assume the player dropped money, and probably won‚Äôt report. Or vice versa and all spenders are going to start getting reported, wasting the companies manpower and making it harder to deal with the issues. Not only that, but the support for this game seems already lacking. Though, dev input and continual updates are very welcomed.\n\nI‚Äôm really disappointed at the lack of ingenuity and moral integrity of these companies lately that feel like a pay to win structure is what the gamers want and/or feel like it is the only way to make bucket loads of cash. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and this method just shows a lack of imagination. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fixable, but once you put in one of these structures, you‚Äôre stuck with it because people have already committed cash. I predict this game dying within a year with maybe a few whales staying around which won‚Äôt pay your San Francisco rent for very long.",

                    "label": "First the good:\n\n-Great art direction\n\n-It‚Äôs Warhammer\n\n-The community is generally pleasant\n\nNow the bad:\n\nIt‚Äôs 2019 and I think everybody knows that combat and advancement in these types of games, in general, strongly favor players who started very early after release and players who are willing to spend money.  But C&C is one of the most egregious examples I have ever seen.  I‚Äôve spent a decent chunk of cash (between $25.00 and $50.00) and I still get bodied left and right. So let‚Äôs break that down:\n\nFor starters, the unit tier structure is totally broken.  Second tier units dominate first tier units and third tier units dominate second tier units.  And by dominate, I mean you can attack tens of thousands of tier 1 units with hundreds of tier 3 units and wipe out the defender without taking loses.  Getting access to higher tier units takes months and months. (unless you‚Äôre willing to pay, of course! üòÉ)  \n\nThose months are drawn out even further because you‚Äôre constantly being robbed by the people at the top of the pyramid and you can‚Äôt accuse enough resources to ascend the tech tree. At this point, I would say it is functionally impossible for a new player to advance high enough up the tech tree to be anything other than a target without spending significant amounts of money.\n\nOn top of that, the combat system is a mess.  Attackers ‚Äúswing‚Äù first, units die in tier order (meaning the weakest troops die first,) and ranged attackers have highest attack priority.  The upshot is that players with access to higher tier units can attack anybody lower than them with what amounts to impunity.  The devs have been saying they‚Äôre going to reevaluate the system for months, but come on.  Overhauling a combat system means pulling out the guts of a game and rebuilding it.  The system as it stands favors the people who pay their bills.  Why would they change it?  So, maybe they‚Äôll get to it some day, but I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath.\n\nFinally, the city capture and Everchosen mechanics give combat and resource buffs to the most powerful players and clans.  The Everchosen mechanic even allows the top player to give DEBUFFS to 8 (?) players of their choosing.\n\nAll of this amounts to a game where the powerful are strongly incentivized to prey on the weak.  If the developer‚Äôs intent was to capture what it must be like to live in the Warhammer world, then mission accomplished. If their intent was to create a fun, balanced game than total failure. If the intent was to milk whales, then huge success.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n+Great art\n\n+Warhammer IP\n\n-Strong pay to win mechanics, even by the standards of the genre\n\nSummary: don‚Äôt bother with C&C unless you‚Äôre willing to shell out hundreds of dollars.",
