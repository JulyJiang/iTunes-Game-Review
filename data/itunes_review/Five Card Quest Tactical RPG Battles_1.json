There is no visual feedback for basic aspects like whose turn is being played out, who has what buff/debuff, or how many turns until an action will trigger. The few visual cues that do exist, like the blinking skull on an enemy about to attack, are cheap looking, not at all clear, and not always accurate.

You basically have to have a Guard in your party, because HP conservation is important and guards have all the good damage-avoiding abilities. Also, the Priest and Mage are significantly better than the Rogue and Archer.\n\n2. The replay value is low. It would have been easy to add something like a simple \"do less damage take more damage\" hard mode or a challenge mode with more limited cards or weaker character classes, but they didn't, and there really isn't much to do after you win for the first time, except maybe try a no-guard run. Also the golden shuffle is pretty useless.\n\n3. And most crippling of all: It's incredibly buggy. Enemies don't show up in the correct positions, sometimes attack indicators show up when they're not supposed to, enemies sometimes delay their attacks for no reason, cards that say they give you a free turn occasionally just fail to do so, and a lot of the card descriptions flat out lie to you. Among these: the rogue's vanish sometimes causes him to disappear indefinitely instead of attacking the following turn, the archer's tactical shuffle sometimes doesn't interrupt the enemy, the guard's mirror shield blocks and reflects all damage, not half (and is incidentally the most broken move in the game because of this), the archer's injury to insult targets the wrong enemy and doesn't do any extra damage, and the priest's Wither move WILL kill him if he uses it at low health, despite the description saying it won't, and what's more, if he dies while casting it, the attack just stops.\n\nIf the bugs were fixed, I would upgrade this to 4 stars but as it stands, I can't give it more than a 2.",

Both times played the layout seemed very similar along with what the vendors sell as well. Fighting is very repetitive. The guard is by far the best unit(1v5'd with the guard as last alive). If I were to give some tips I'd say start with the archer(highest damage dealing class) & guard. Rogue is pretty solid too. Priest is good for final battle. Mage is average. Basically, all you gotta do is take the least amount of dmg possible. Avoiding dmg is more important than dealing dmg. There's a skull indicator when an enemy is about to strike across. So you try to \"interrupt\" them or move into a different lane so your guard can tank the hit. The game needs more variation. Perhaps they should add equips for the units and monster loot",

I wanna say it's like a card battler, roguelike, RPG-lite type game, but it combines all of these elements so flawlessly that it doesn't come across as a hybrid game. It's just so beautifully done on every spectrum. The game does lag a bit on my iPhone 5 running iOS 7.1.2, but that's kind of to be expected by now with my ancient device and outdated OS... however, when I upgrade, this will be one of the first handfull of titles to get switched over to the new phone. Just like Mage Gauntlet and Wayward Souls, this game will be on my phone until it doesn't work anymore. THANK YOU FOR SUCH AN AMAZINGLY WELL DONE GAME, ROCKETCAT!!!!\n\n**update**\n\nThank you for the update! I didn't think you guys could, but the performance enhancements really made the game play a LOT smoother on my phone. The new card menus, battle info and icons letting you know when enemies will hit were all fantastic additions to this already great squad based rogue-like.",

It scratches an itch I've been trying to reach for a while for a simple and easy to control (with just one thumb) game that feels different and strategic every time I play and can be picked up and put down easily. I highly recommend it, but just know what you're buying and make sure you have that same itch to scratch. :)",

Enemies freeze.  Sometimes they vanish and you can't defeat them (which ends your game). Sometimes your interrupts (particularly for the rogue) suddenly quit working. Some cards NEVER work right (like the mage's firestorm spell).  Was this tested at all?

But, this game is riddled with poor game design and bugs. \n\nThe combat is very confusing to try and get used to, as there is no tutorial. Skills feel inconsistent and confusing, such as the Priest spell that blocks all incoming damage for that turn. The game does not tell you, however, that it only applies to the Priest. \n\nThere's also a few visual glitches, where dead enemies will stay on the screen, or enemies that were interrupted will stay still until they die.\n\nAlso, there's a lot of cards and options that are blatantly better than others. Mages and Guards feel like mandatory additions to your party, as the Guard is the only class that can effectively keep everyone alive, and the Mage has insane damage and utility.\n\nMy thoughts on how to improve the game, other than fixing obvious bugs, would be to add more interrupts to the other classes. Rogues have a cool concept on paper, but feel lacking in damage. Archers are fairly well done but are outshined by Mages in damage and Guards in protection. Priests need to be able to protect others, maybe even buff allies or give minor healing.\n\nThese really hold the game back from being great and makes it very hard to recommend in it's current state. Hopefully we'll get a few updates to fix the bugs and balance classes. Until then, keep your eye on this one, it has potential!",

                    "label": "Rocketcat has made some of my favorite games. Sadly I feel FCQ lacks the polish and smart gameplay of their other efforts. It is very buggy (game just froze and lost progress after an hour of play) and things that should be clear to a player are not: when enemy attacks, exactly what a card does, etc. I like the art but the way enemies and your characters are stacked up in a line makes it hard to discern each figure and, worse, which character is highlighted. The map is ugly and adds nothing, and text size varies to fill the text box which is also ugly and just badly designed. Animations are not smooth and timing is off. Overall this game lacks the polish I expect from Rocketcat. The current gameplay is kinda fun but it feels random and a lot of the mechanics feel mysterious too. Plus the play sessions feel too long for a game that makes you start from scratch when you die. Makes replaying a drag. All that said I look forward to more games from this developer.",

Game feels like a beta but the graphics look like a 5yr old arts and craft. There is zero tutorial and zero help. The buttons are not intuitive and the effects are so lagged that you cannot even guess what the buttons do. Waste of $3, I will be emailing apple why they allow garbage beta apps to be published.",
