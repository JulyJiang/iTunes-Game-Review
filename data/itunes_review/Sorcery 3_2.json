While it was not as frustrating as Sorcery 2 with mandatory replays to finish, it has similar issues with some hard to find quest areas.  \n\nPros:\n-The changing environment with the beacons' light\n-Nice continuity with the first two\n-More interesting monsters to fight and a few new spells \n-Swindlestones is back!  But another game or some variant rules or handicaps would have been nice.\n\nCons:\n-Some non-choice decision trees\n-Too short (to be fair the main story is probably a little longer than Sorcery 2 without the backtracking)\n-Relatively empty landscape so a lot of your quest is spent traveling, eating and sleeping (and stupid mud trying to slurp up your boots).  It's particularly evident when you're running around looking for the last serpent you missed somehow.\n- The ending is...less than epic.  Sure it's not the final chapter, but there's no building to a climax here; just a to do list and a nebulous time limit.\n\nSo in summary Sorcery 3 is a solid, albeit short, game book.  It is a fitting continuation of the saga but if you had problems with previous installments this is more of the same.",

The gameplay challenges have multiple solutions, so many different playstyles can get you to the end of the game successfully (though killing ALL seven serpents is a challenge, especially if you don't keep your eyes open for clues). Nearly every problem can be tackled in multiple ways, and unlike the gamebooks that inspired it, the game is pretty scrupulous about keeping players from innocently locking themselves out of victory. \n\n(That is to say, if you can't get a boat to cross that lake, your quest isn't unwinnable... but you might need to do a lot of swimming.)\n\nFinally, there's a game mechanic I won't spoil that knocked my socks off, was probably a nightmare to code so smoothly, and gives nearly every location in the game depth, revisitability, and a sense of history.\n\nI still prefer Sorcery! 2 for its fantastic setting, but it's amazing that this adaptation/rewrite of S3 made it even NEARLY as good.\n\nMust buy.",

I was instantly hooked onto the Sorcery series, and have been awaiting this game since the announcement. I love it! I feel like Sorcery 3 encourages you to use more spells than the other 2 games (at least the way I played them), and the time mechanic is very interesting. If you love games that draw you in, and don't mind a bit of reading, then I encourage you to get this!\n\nOne note is that on my iPad mini 2nd gen, the device gets quite warm while playing the game and drains the battery awfully quick compared to the first two in the series. It might be the new mechanics at work or just isn't fully optimized yet. I've had a couple of crashes, but the game auto saves after almost every event, so no worries there.",

Breathtaking, non linear interactivity and freedom to move back and forth across the land.\n\nPerhaps they've gone a little too far as I never disliked the essential linear and canned nature of game books.  They've also taken more extensive liberties with the story line then we've seen before.\n\nStill I'm impressed with this bold and ground breaking installment.  It's now obvious why Inkle required more time to bring this installment to us.  I would just suggest a more perfect balance of game / story would dial it back to where you aren't frequently faced with wondering where to go or what to do next or feeling like you're running against a clock.\n\nPlease note that due to the much more sophisticated 3D map performance is unsatisfactory on older devices such as my iPhone 4.  I'm playing on my LG Nexus 5 where it runs flawlessly until I get my iPad repaired.\n\nGood:\nEver more sophisticated gaming mechanics (spell effect timers, daily status updates, et al)\n3D map updates\nIncreasing complexity of spell system (new spells & spell countering)\n\nLess Good:\nA bit too open ended?\nToo many liberties with original lore?\nPoor graphics performance \n\nHighly recommended!",

Their worlds are so rich that you'll want to play through the series at least twice. \n\nWithin the series so far, I would rank Sorcery! 2 as the best and Sorcery! 3 as a close second, but all three are 5-star games in my book.

                    "label": "It might be somewhat of a defamation to even call this game text based: The map and environment art that meticulously illustrate most every detail of the game's world certainly belie such a description. Yet this game represents the culmination, in many senses, of the text based game. The encounters, the puzzles, even the combat are all text based, and the game as a whole is adapted from (though it has greatly expanded upon) a pen and paper gamebook from 1984. All of these have been excellently and seamlessly translated to the electronic medium, and players of the first two Sorcery games will be able to attest to the magnificent competency that Inkle has displayed in pure adaptation. But the revolution that this game represents would have been too much for that storied medium, for want of player patience in recording all the variables that are now electronically tracked if not nothing else. The game takes the player across four distinct yet interconnected environments (each fleshed out and interesting individually) and gives the player free reign to explore them. It may not be immediately apparent how incredible a feat of game design that is in itself. Text based games have long endeavored to provide the illusion of freedom, with various degrees of success. This is not unique to text based games, but it has been more necessary for them on account of their basic nature. Text based games create a world through narrative. When movement or phenomena are conveyed by the narrative they are described rather than displayed; and so repetition would be far more monotonous and far less tolerated than it would be for a more visual medium. Think of Assassin’s Creed 4 and its ship taking animation: every time a ship is taken the same animation takes place (albeit with slightly different character models). This kind of repetition is tolerated in a visual medium because the spectacle is absorbed passively. But in a text based medium, where the reader has to work to absorb the information, this sort of repetition would be regarded as insulting rather than merely discourteous, and the user experience would suffer. In order to avoid this, the text based game has traditionally insured that the player only experiences any given encounter once per playthrough, by funneling him/her in one direction, usually with some sort of story based justification (such as a pressing journey, or a race around the world.) This same approach was used in Mass Effect 3, with the majority of gameplay taking place in environments that are only accessible once per playthrough. After all, if you wanted to make a realistic rapidly collapsing frontline freely accessible, you’d have to design multiple environments to reflect the changes that would presumably be taking place throughout the game: You’d need a pre-invasion Thessia, a first contact Thessia, a deteriorated Thessia, and a devastated Thessia. Every character would have to have dialogue reflecting each unique situation; every building would need different models for various states of repair. That task, compounded across multiple environments, would have multiplied the development costs, and the workload. The financial cost required for the extra HD art textures and animations would have likely rendered the game unprofitable. The effort that would be required to write and record for so many theoretical situations (that the player would likely never even see) would be irrational. But text is cheap, and Inkle is insane. They did exactly that. Every environment in the game can be explored at any time. You can walk back to the starting area a stone’s throw away from the ending. Hell, you are encouraged to: a fast travel hub lies right next to the end (That’s right, fast travel in a text game-and it needs it too!) Rather than break or buckle from the enormity of the task, Inkle has embraced it, by giving the player the power to transform any (any) part of the game world into an entirely different terrain (think desert into farmland, Steppe into Swamp). With these changes the character interactions change, the treasures to be found change, the random encounters change (this game doesn’t overdo random encounters). And what’s even more, these alternate forms feed into each other. A man killed on one version of an environment may be a rotting corpse on the other. A Woman beat in dice in one version may leave a message for you based on that in the other. (People who have played the previous games in the Sorcery saga will have even more variables depending on what choices they made in those games).There are many other positive remarks I could make about this game, about the minigames never seeming tacked on, or the lack of micro-transactions, or the superiority of the save transfer system. But you should really experience those things for yourself. This game is $5.00. That’s because it’s “only” a text based game on the App store. But because it’s text based it does things that no other game has ever attempted. Because it’s text based, extra environments were a matter of work and ingenuity rather than money. Because it’s text based, this game is the best game on the App store.\nPS. Since they don’t fit into the context of the review, I’ll put my complaints here. Poor optimization for iPad mini (over world text is sometimes hard to read, due to what I guess is bad resolution scaling) occasional lag, occasional crashes. Other than the poor screen resolution scaling, I regard all of these problems as inevitable and blame them on my old hardware (original 2012 model) rather than the game.",
