It’s like someone is selling you the first 2/3rd of a book and having no option to read the ending! The games are pieces of the story and do not have concrete endings until you finish all three. All of your choices carry over game to game and have a huge impact on the final ending you receive. Without having the third game available on iOS you’re forced to play through on a different platform without any of the choices you made carrying over. Absolutely ridiculous of the studio to choose to release only two of the games when they made it such a continuous experience.",

The darkness of humanity and civilization combat the better angels of our nature, usually between parties but often within individuals, including you, the player, who is forced to make difficult decisions that impact the game and your relationships within it. This combines with a unique system of resource management and combat mechanics that leave you wanting more. By the end of the game (which I played for at least 12 hours), you forget the somewhat steep price (for a mobile game) because the experience is well worth it. Stoic has gone above and beyond with this saga. I will be purchasing parts 2 (on iOS) and 3 (on PS4).",

I have a couple gripes 3 main ones but they do not necessarily impact how awesome this game is they are just things I expected included in a “caravan” game. \n1. Free roam- there is no free roam but the story is very well done and beautiful, surprising I have a PS4, a gaming computer and this game took me off those for hours. However free roam with free reigns would have been a good idea as a side mode. \n2. When you are moving in combat if you ment to move 1 space further or not as far you cannot go back, also the tiles are so small it’s easy to make a mistake, nothing gamebreaking here though.\n3. This one really broke my heart almost as much as the 1st issue, when you have a large caravan you still only fight with your group of heroes, you get no support from the 100-800 fighters in your group. Really, you should get an AI ally in battle for every 50 or 100 soldiers in your caravan that way the more you have the more it actually helps in the game. Just donate they kills to a random team member I guess, or give extra renoun if the AI soldier kills an enemy. There is also too many heroes to upgrade with the small renoun you get as well as keeping supplies enough for a huge army that you do nothing with. Really heartbreaking for me, things like these make it a beat once and uninstall. Still good game but kills replay ability for me.",

This con would be a nonissue on an iPad. \nThe save system isn’t very user friendly. It doesn’t say when it autosaves, and there is no option to save yourself. I’ve lost progress many times because I’m never sure when I can stop playing. \n\nThe game is difficult to play on the go. To enjoy it you need dedicated time to sit down and finish encounter after encounter.\nWould recommend but with a strong caveat that it’s not a very “mobile” mobile game.",

It is totally possible in a real fight, some guys-like archers-would stay in one place. Why can’t I move the same guy twice in a row? I have to waste a turn telling an archer to stay in place. \n2. Got a little boring watching my numbers go down-morale, clansmen, varl, supplies-as my little line of dudes marched on through the viking wilderness. I would have liked the option for the caravan members to hunt along their way. Maybe the game developers wanted to stress the cruel leanness of the times. Something to think about. \n    This game is extremely story driven, lots and lots of choosing dialogue and watching cartoon twiddling of fingers and blinking.\nThat said, the animation is awesome, the dialogue smart, and the soundtrack beautiful. The backstory is compelling and I had quite a few hours being engrossed.",

Renown can be hard to come by with larger parties and without class specializations, characters can sometimes feel too similar. Still, you won’t find a better RPG experience. Well done!",

Here are ways the game fell down:\n—Sound. The developers advertise the game’s sound track as being excellent but after I muted on the first day of play I was never able to get the game to make any sounds at all. Bug.  \n—Game mechanics:  I struggled to be able to consistently make correct selections on the first try because icons are so small on my screen. Outside of the closed caption character dialogue, the fonts were so small as to be very difficult/impossible to read. At times, in combat, I could not see characters that were “behind” (diagonally above). Being able to rotate the board would have been helpful. The mechanism for adding or removing characters from the 6-person battle lineup was clunky/inconsistent/frustrating.  \n—Text:  since I could not hear anything I had to use buttons to navigate the text. It sometimes would skip so I got an incomplete understanding of the dialogue. A “back” button would have helped.  \n—Story:  I was totally shocked when the game ended. ( I won’t give it away in case you still want to play).  There were SEVERAL key plot mechanisms left totally unresolved.  Maybe they will get addressed in the sequel but for the cost of the game I feel they should have been resolved in the first purchase.  As is, inadequate value. If a person has to spend another $9.99 to get the tail end of what should have been in the first game... that’s pretty lame.",

                    "label": "I loved this game on Mac and now playing through it on hard difficulty on iOS. Unfortunately I encountered this gamebreaking bug: after the first fight in the first war, the gray screen appears with a clickable arrow to go on to the following fight. I spent a long time carefully orchestrating a good strategy that took a good anount of time to plan and play out, maybe 25 minutes. The arrow on the gray screen however wasn’t clickable and the game essentially was stuck; I tried anything I could think of like rotating the iPhone screen, tapping home button then coming back to the app, tapping and swiping anywhere...to no avail. When i hard exited the app from the OS and restarted it, as knew would happen, the war progress is gone and I need to start from the last auto save; very frustrating after a long, hard fight that had gone well and I don’t think I’m going to try it again after a while given it seems like it’ll just hang again...\n\nThis game is a wonderful work of art and a great accomplishment in terms of game design, artwork, music, and I find it very unfortunate that a few polish issues got by the quality assurance that really interrupt the flow and immersion. I actually encountered this exact bug on the Mac Desktop version, but in that case alt tabbing out and back took care of it. I have a hard time believing this somehow never came up in testing and somehow wasn’t taken care of. I’m on iPhone 6 by the way. \n\nMy actual rating for this game is more like 4+ stars, but I am currently frustrated at the loss of progress, and it would certainly be 5 stars if bugs like didn’t appear, as well as some small improvements to the display that I wrote about in a rewiew of BS2: when displaying all armor / str flags in combat, surround enemy flags by a red outline to make them stand out from your own heroes more and make it easier to parse information; add a second buttton that when pressed shows numbers next to the enemy units on the battlefield representing their turn order: 1 for next, 2 for one after that etc. These small quality of life improvements to help display information and the player parse said information that is already available,more easily would make the game more of a pleasure to play, for me personally.",

Really annoying when I’m doing great and the screen gets stuck.  😒\n\nPlease fix and maybe add a feature for full screen?  Will change to 5 ⭐️’s if glitch is corrected.\n\nUPDATE\n\nHave been playing on my iPad mini and it’s a much better experience.  The screen doesn’t get stuck in a fixed location.

                    "label": "Its a complex game, so there are a lot of elements to cover. As far as mechanics, I am a stranger to turn based combat. Despite a harsh learning curve, I really enjoyed the combat/leveling system in this game. I found Normal to be difficult enough that I was constantly challenged but not excessively frustrated, which is a pretty ideal spot. The party management system I found not quite as great. The plot premise of the system was interesting, but in practice I was often annoyed. In particular, having you choose between making your characters stronger and keeping your party alive was probably not the best way to do it, though many might disagree . As far as the infamous choice elements of the game, I think they overdid it. So many games the choices don’t mean anything at all, so it was refreshingly different but I feel they went too far in that direction. Often times there was one (often arbitrary appearing) “good” choice, rather than good and bad consequences to all choices. And some of the bad choices are so bad (and also somewhat arbitrary) you can almost ruin the game either missing things or changing things so drastically, to the point that I found myself using the internet instead of enjoying the story. Speaking of which, the overall story arc is fairly typical fantasy stuff, which I suppose shouldn’t be a surprise. The evil guys tended to be kind of one dimensional and typical, but the good characters were much more interesting to me (and not so good either). The side plots and numerous characters were perhaps the coolest part of the game. The characters in this game stand out among RPGs that I’ve played and the writers don’t hesitate to get too “adult” and serious. My only complaint there is that there are too many things going on, too many characters to keep track of and the game is way too short to fully flesh them out, with a couple exceptions. I often found myself wondering who the person was and had to google it. Maybe the sequels will alleviate that. Artwork is fantasy/comic style and very impressive (though I played on a phone so I probably did not get the best experience). Same with the music which is all actual instruments and not cheap synths, which definitely adds to the mood and realism. I encountered zero glitches, no long loading screens, etc. I would recommend this game despite its flaws (and I’m about to start the sequel). This is (obviously) all opinion and I’m sure many will disagree, but that’s my two cents.",
