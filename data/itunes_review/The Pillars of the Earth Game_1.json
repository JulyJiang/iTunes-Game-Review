Unfortunately I’ll have to read the actual book to find out what happens due to slow gameplay, and a real nasty bug. \n\nIt’s never a nice experience when games force players to walk everywhere, especially games where you have to wander back and forth a lot. It’s not immersive to watch an avatar crawl across a screen, it’s painful. \n\nSimilarly, not letting players read and skip dialogue—the voice acting is great, but sometimes the content isn’t exciting enough to wait around for, and other times you have to replay a scene because your progress wasn’t saved. Better to let the player be in control of the pace. \n\nThe controls don’t work well on iPhoneX. The buttons are so close to the bottom of the screen that they trigger the phone’s app selection mode. It would just be a bit annoying, but it caused my game to fatally crash. Now I’d have to reinstall to play, and I just can’t bring myself to crawl around a story I’ve already seen.",

This is a great idea that I believe the genre will keep around. Would highly recommend for fans of this type of game.",

It would be the first game that I ever replayed a game in 30 some years. I recommend it to those who enjoy a good adventure game and a good story plus amazing sound and art work. Be prepared to not want to stop though and it’s not a two hour game.  Impressive in every way!  Can’t imagine how it’s not a 5 star rating or higher! I will watch for more games by this developer. My review although I sent it never viewed in reviews I am resending it before contacting the store. What’s up with that?  I’ve never had this problem before.  Waiting for the next chapters!",

At first I thought the glitches were because of my phone, but the game only lets me play so far every once in a while before crashing. Half the time I open the game and can touch my screen all I want but nothing happens. Tried contacting support but with no luck. Finally caved and deleted and reinstalled the game only to have the same problem with all my progress (up to chapter 4) gone. The visuals are beautiful for a phone game but it's worthless if you can't actually play the game.",

My only problems are that at times the audio can randomly cut out and I will have to restart the game, I’m having problems with touch controls, I don’t mean they sometimes don’t work, I actually can’t click anything.  Maybe I can figure out the issue.  And at times I’m also having problems with saves.  The saves are sometimes not working and take me to a black screen with some random questionable audio.

Otherwise: beautiful artwork, compelling storyline, and interesting characters with impressive voiceovers. Worth the money even with the small glitches. Great work!",
