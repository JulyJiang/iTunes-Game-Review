The result is that games often time out. \n\nIf I am not actively in a game when it ends, there’s no way to see the results. It just disappears from my list as soon as it ends. \n\nThe chat resets every time I minimize the app on my phone which makes it pretty much impossible to use.

The game plays smoothly, the controls are easy to use, it has a lot of features that I really like like farm highlighting. The AIs are challenging at different levels. I haven’t had any trouble with online play or setting up a game against my wife. \n\nA lot of people have complained about the game just ending when the time you set at the beginning runs out. That sounds really annoying but I just always set it to the max (14 days or something) and it hasn’t been a problem. \n\nAll in all I love Carcassonne as a board game and I really like how it was implemented here as an app.",

The next time, the game was in the middle of scoring, but it hadn’t stopped my clock (which again, was running too fast), and the clock ran out in the middle of scoring so it automatically recorded a loss for me. The camera always pans away from the full board when someone places a tile. I’m constantly adjusting the camera so I can see the board after I’ve placed my tile. Why do I want to stare at my just-placed tile until the other player places theirs? I don’t. This interpretation of the game is just not as clean and nice and simple and functional as the previous version.\n\nAs a side note, I bought this game on Nintendo Switch as well. I was excited to play Carcassonne online there ... but, no dice! There is no online!",

It’s written without consideration of different platforms and basic rules of designing good human interfaces.\n\nI saw other comments about ‘old’ users liking their ways ... this is just plain arrogant. Listen to the criticism and make it fun and playable. The old app certainly was!\n\nI forfeit my first game, deleted the app I just paid for  but will check back in a six months.

                    "label": "TL;DR - If you are new to Carcassonne and want to hone your skills or learn, this is a 5 star game, period. I’m in that boat, so my review as follows is from that POV:\n\nI’m new to the game (literally played the board game for the first time last night) and obviously seen the light! But I don’t know how often, especially in quarantine, I’m going to get games together, and I really want to increase my skill. As I was playing I could tell there were strategies to be had and plays to be made but I wasn’t skilled enough to see them yet. This app is perfect for that.\n\nGameplay: The AI is fast, unsure the complaints from others (maybe with a lot of expansions? I don’t know).\n\nThe gameplay is super intuitive. The animation is a nice touch, and the ability to visualize fields is a life saver. Also little things like squares that become forever unplayable being highlighted opened up my eyes to that as a tactic I had never considered. \n\nFor all those that say this looks “cheap” you realize the game in real life is cardboard and block meeples right? This isn’t going to look like that, the material is different. I get that people love their original artwork and this community is up there with comic book and Star Wars fans when demanding things be a certain way - but just understand the translation of the board game to an app in looks just doesn’t work as a 1:1 mirror. So with that in mind, I think the developers made smart creative decisions, which they had to.\n\nAs a new player, this rules, thanks for the great app.",

I don’t know the old app. But this one is good and worth paying a couple of dollars for.\n\nYou can play against a very good AI, the last one of the four is very tough (at least for me) - the others easier. You can play online against other players which also worked well for me. I didn’t notice any lag as some complained about.  \n\nA brief tutorial for the first time player might be helpful when facing other humans. I’m still not sure what the icons in the game selection menu really mean and I have no idea what the ranking points are and how to gain or lose them. I’m also not sure if those games or with abbot and river or just standard. I didn’t buy any of the other expansions yet.\n\nIn sum, I like it. I almost wouldn’t have bought it because of the reviews.

Fix the graphics ... too busy so it is difficult to see key features.  Something just makes this much more difficult to understand and see versus competitor version \n4.

But then perversely you can’t zoom out far enough to see the whole board the larger it gets.\nThe animations are distracting and again slow down gameplay. \nI haven’t yet tried to play online, as I can barely get through a standard game it’s so clunky...but from what I hear from friends it’s a disaster.\nI bought every single expansion on the the old app and loved what they added to the gameplay, but I won’t be spending another cent on this until things are significantly improved. In fact, I might even try to get my money back as this game is so frustrating as to be almost unplayable.   \nSeriously, learn from the old app. It’s not about nostalgia, it’s about good design and better gameplay.\nIt’s sad.

I’ve been playing single player and online with family and enjoyed both.  Yes there is room for improvement but give them a chance to address the issues. \n\nPros - good adaptation of actual game, intuitive interface, overall good art, AI keeps single player interesting, you can play with your friends online, you can set time limits such that playing with friends can essentially be turn based so games can go over many days, features like showing fields and tiles left is fun, seems only host of online game needs expansions for everyone to play expansion\n\nCons - needs a recap feature because if you aren’t online at the end you can’t see how an online game ended, the chat in online play disappears every time you leave so you can’t have a dialogue, sometimes takes a moment to connect or disconnects but not terribly so, wish you could turn specific features in expansions on and off (e.g. use builder but not pig or just use tiles from expansions but not other mechanics), can only add friends to friends list if they are online. \n\nOverall I’ve enjoyed both the single and online play. Absolutely worth the cost if you enjoy the board game.",

I have to change my password about half the time because it doesn't recognize it anymore.\n\nThe in-game view is at a side angle, not top down, making it difficult to see info on the board that is critical to playing the game. I realize this view is for the 3d, but why do i care about 3d if it makes the game hard to play? Im sure the graphics also have an affect on load time. I looked for a down res option, but there is only “normal” and some enhanced version that I forget the name of. They should call it “the even slower option.”\n\nYour friends have to be searched through a chat, and they must be online with the game active on their screen. Even then, individual users are difficult to find.  \n\nThis all adds up to a massively frustrating experience. Im only still using it because some of my friends didn't get to the previous app before it was too late. I’d be furious if I’d paid more than $5. We were going to switch to Ticket To Ride, but saw that app is also from Asmodee. No way are they getting another dime of my money.",

Very disappointed. At the very least they could have allowed registered players to restore 3D. You are getting a very negligible graphics upgrade for 4.99-20+ price tag. If that’s your thing, you’ll want to buy it. If you want a great implementation of the game in 2D, stick with the original. Embarrassingly greedy, Asmodee.",
