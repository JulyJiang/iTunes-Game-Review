I haven’t pulled a single five star adventurer in over 5 months! You’d think it’s just bad luck. If only. Turns out with a update they did a while back, they lowered the pull rates for 5 stars. Scummiest thing I ever heard. And they didn’t even say that they were changing it in the update notes. Now I’m hardly playing it because the game is no longer rewarding enough. Fix the pull rates man. Their crap.",

So unless you’ve previously gone through menus you’d never go through, your data is just lost.\n\nOh well. Probably for the best I stopped playing anyway. Was getting a little repetitive, Fienne still a 3-star character despite being the literal face of the game, and the new episodes are mainly just dialogue to draw out the play time. Or if you don’t devote hours a day to the game, you’re characters start getting seriously under powered. Not to mention you have better odds of winning the lottery than getting enough Chant scripts to upgrade more than one character a year.",

The best part is once you’re done with the story, there’s tons more content to play - all for free. This is not a pay-to-win game. All of the content is available to f2p players. Getting the stones (in-game currency) is fairly easy for dedicated players, and in two years of playing I haven’t bought any. As a f2p player, I still have multiple teams of 5-star characters. The best part? New content is added almost monthly (if not more often than that). The developers do a wonderful job providing additional content for the game regularly, and it is all free.\n\nIf you like Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger or other games like those, download Another Eden right now. You won’t regret it.",

I read a factual article about another eden having false draw rates on global release. So most race hating country for video games? Going to make an article about this later. With japan treating global players bad with most games talk out of the way.\n\nAnother EDEN is a beautiful game. Story is well done and I enjoyed it. Sadly the new content coming out is getting harder without having key characters to beat the content. Only thing I wish is that 10 draw give 4.5 and not 3.5 as 4 stars. Only time I recommend spending money is when the pick a 5 star is out wish is really rare.\n\nUpdate from close to the end of 2020:  game is boring and that’s a fact, draw rates where rigged in jp and japan players got 10k crystals for catching them scamming them. Global did not. Rates are kind of bad. Spent money on this about 80 dollars but feels like I only played 10 dollars worth. Jp gets bonus draws every so often global does not. \n\nContent release: they pushed back the region several times for global players because they didn’t want players to have a free 10 pull when it was released. Wish jp released games get banned from entering my country since 80% shaft global players treating them unequally. Very sad of japan.",

Holy cow. \n\nNot only are the micro transactions in no way required if you are used to grinding in JRPGs, but they can *gasp* be genuinely helpful from time to time. \n\nBeyond that, this is more of a sequel to Chrono Trigger than Chrono Cross was. There are Easter eggs everywhere for die hard fans. I’ve been waiting years for this game, and it has been hiding in plain site on the friggin App Store of all places. I typically despise playing games on my phone, but I’m over 10 hours in with this one so far, and I’m just scratching the surface (I’ve also spent $0 to get this far). I plan on throwing some money at the developers just to support it, as others have mentioned, so don’t let the in-app purchases turn you away. This is an insane game to be giving away. If you play it, you’ll understand why we are all volunteering our money regardless.",

It has so many of my favorite game elements in it, drawing inspiration from classics like Chrono Trigger (about 75% similar!!), Star Ocean, a bit of Xenogears, Final Fantasy, and more. If you are a millennial gamer who has nostalgia for older games, fit for a modern mobile device, this is absolutely the game for you. There is no paywall to this game, nor any need to pay to proceed in the game storyline. No energy that runs out - it is, truly, an RPG with no limits to how far you can progress at once. That element alone makes the game binge-worthy, but even more importantly, this game has a great plot, inspired by the highlights of the the best games, and has a philosophical approach that wows me for how deep the meaning of the storyline goes, similar in a way to Final Fantasy 9’s approach to determining what makes a soul. I honestly love this game, and I’m so happy to have found it. It’s exactly what I was seeking, and it feels like a breath of fresh air.",

                    "label": "I will try to limit this review mostly to those areas where I think the game could be significantly improved, whether in terms of functionality, or consistency (subquests mostly). This is a great game though, so if you are considering to play it, I would definitely recommend it. There are very few cohesive RPGs on the app store, and I would say this is one of them.\n\nWhat do I mean when I say \"cohesive\"? Ara Fell, by Stegasoft is a great example of a mobile rpg done (mostly) right, and in a more traditional way, emulating a console experience in terms of fundamentals of gameplay. As far as concerns Another Eden, I would say that it is a good example of a more mobile, or \"touch screen\" focused mechanics done mostly well. An example of how badly that can go, I would say is found in the Romancing SaGa 2 port for iOS. I am partial to the more traditional format, as that's what I grew up with, and I prefer the experience of playing the game being more akin to playing my old gameboy, or PSP, or what have you. Nonetheless, while it took some getting used to, I have come to greatly enjoy this game.\n\nThe main issue with the game has to do with particulars of the system which lets you gain more party members, and with subquests. It's essentially the same issue. Basically, I've found two instances so far where I was able to gain access to a subquest that exposed me to part of the plot that hadn't been covered yet. (For the devs: specifically, the character subquests for Nero and Cyrus that are available in Ratle, and Aectuel respectively. I'm only at level 22, and so I'm sure there are other instances of this with other characters. If this is by design, then I think it represents something less than stellar. However, if it is merely an oversight, then I believe it should be rectified.)\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who is a serious RPG fan. There are some subtle nods, obvious to fans of Chrono Trigger, and plenty of other niceties beyond the games substance. The writing is so off the wall at times... varying from genuinely deep, and emotional (in the non-obligatory sidequests mostly), to horribly stereotypical and clichéd (I found myself face-palming a lot at times), and everywhere in between. It starts off feeling like it's not going to be all that much, and then little by little starts to sink in the enormity of scope of the plot. Some interesting crossovers as well at points. Of course... there is the hilarious oddity of this being yet another rpg where the first scene with the protagonist involves him being woken up by a sister/mother/childhood friend, and chided for his laziness. And the basic substance of the overarching plot is, yet again, man's offense against the natural world, dualistic philosophy (supernatural dark vs. light struggling for balance/dominance), the cliché modern slogan of: \"we'll keep aiming for that better future\" as the seeming moral of the story, and further evidence of the conflicting attitude the Japanese have toward their own heritage: simultaneously seeking to romanticize aspects of their past, such as the nobility of the samurai warrior, while also making commentary constantly about rejecting the encroachment of western values (e.g. christian ones), but then also taking the time to rail against aspects of their traditional identity that \"don't fit\" in the modern world. You'll see hints of this in the first sub plot when you go to the future for the first time. This game has left me guessing many times.",

All the love to the team behind Another Eden. Also loved the various references to some of my favorite JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and Xenogears.\nCons: just a few such as buggy updates and the fact that the most recent updates made the load screen at the beginning take forever to finish.
