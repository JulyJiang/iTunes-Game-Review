However, I don’t know how to put new people in my klan ring, for as I try, the original people appear to be there. There was a person on YouTube who did this easily, but I cannot for some reason. This othere person was also visually impaired, as I am and used his vision whereas I use VoiceOver from Apple. I also can’t see how to safely complete one of the hero quests and remember all that happened in the myth at the same time. Good game, though/worth its money if a little frustrating at times.\nAshleigh Piccinino\nP.S. I’ve noticed some very strange things happening with the game. If too many things are open, the game can crash/have to reopen the game. Plus, it’s hard for me to constantly scroll through all the options as I’m using the VoiceOver system on my iPhone to do so. I think this game needs major improvements as far as being more accessable with VoiceOver. The map doesn’t work hardly at all, saying “unknown hex” or “explored hex.” What does that mean? And why doesn’t VoiceOver speak the plaes on the map—it does but very rarely. I need to know where I’m sending my people to, in cardinal diretions, you know. Also, if you need to read an entire manual to play a game, it’s not a game at all...I don’t think. Why can’t the manual be in a few brf files you can save on your computer and read with a Braille display? That way, you have something to refer to without having to go bak into the menu, back into the manual, and back into what you’re happening to have trouble with. Not worth the ten dollars, in my opinion until these things get fixed.",

When I do try to view tribes it crashes the whole game and takes me back to my phones home screen. I’m at loss... it never did this before. Could it be an iOS update that messed it up? Please get back to me concerning this as I would appreciate it, immensely. Really enjoyed playing KoDP. Was a five star game, current problem withheld\n\nUPDATE: Thank you so much for correcting the issues and in such a timely manner, developers. You’re appreciated greatly!",

There are no ads, and absolutely no disappointments. It's a better layout on an IPad, but the game is the same on my phone. I run two games very different from each other on my two devices. Great game for getting a 12+ kid interested in reading. Has the feel of a fantasy book like dragon lance novels, with the control of civilization. It is choose your own adventure style, but unlike other games that basically end up the same no matter what you decide, this game has tons of different paths to victory and defeat. Mad props to the creator of this game. I pray for the gods to bless them and for them to be inspired to add more or create a second sage or prequel.",

That all being said, when you advertise your game as fully playable with VoiceOver, I expect that to be true. The map is frustrating at best, navigation order on several screens leaves much to be desired, we need a more precise way to adjust numerical values and in several cases, vital text is missing, leaving you to make a choice with no information.. This last can be disastrous, and comes up most often during quests.\nWith a little work a 5 star app easily, but right now, I feel 3 is more than generous.",

So I bought it. \n\nSocial aspects of life are showcased in kodp's wonderful random events and the common tech trees are replaced with sacrifices and heroquests for the gods. All the magic is a nice change of pace from civilization games. \n\nOf course, not all sacrifices produce results (sometimes even large ones). The randomness keeps the game fresh each playthrough but can be punishing at times. \n\nThe game is text based, so if reading isn't your thing then this isn't for you.\n\nHighly entertaining, endless replay value, fresh take on civilization management with focus on relationships instead of conquest (conquest isn't really an option), lots of backstory to read. Great at demonstrating consequences of your actions. 5/5",

One of the more fascinating aspects is the hero questing, where a leader travels to the lands of the gods and pays homage. This event is the highlight of the year for your tribe and can bring great blessing or your leader can come home in pieces. It also makes you wonder about your ethics if you were a tribal leader. Raid and pillage your neighbor every fall? Clearly... They came to your clan hall and dropped a duce in front of your throne (true story). Moreover, it's a world that not clearly understood by any of the characters, leading to the mystery. Enjoy the music and some of the most complex gameplay you'll find in the App Store.

Also the game can go from extremely serious (being raided by chaos monsters who can lay waste to your most elite men) to light hearted humor (meeting duck warriors who want their stolen eggs back lol).

Gods and spirits have a great impact on daily life in Dragonpass, and you'll find yourself sacrificing silver, cattle, maybe even thrills to keep them happy. Many common fantasy races are present as allies or adversaries, but with a unique twist. Take the nomadic riders of Prax, who are forbidden from riding horses so they ride fantastic beasts such as antelope, rhinos, elephants, etc. Elves exist as xenophobic plant-men. Dwarves have a culture and society that is highly foreign to humanity. True dragons have the power of gods. Dragon-folk exist as the Dragonewts, creatures that evolve into more advanced forms, eventually becoming dragons over the eons, and reincarnate into new bodies as they die. Trolls are a race gifted with immortality and great strength, but cursed with infertility. This setting has such a rich and intriguing lore, it is well worth the time and monetary investment.",

The game is so heavy in content that there are areas I have yet to explore. Highly recommend for those who enjoy the choose your adventure meets RPG elements wrapped up into one game and then some.",

Tons of hours of gameplay. Hi replay value as there's so many scenarios you want to revisit. Highly recommended for old-school PC RPG fans as well as blind or low vision users as voice over works well. Sort of feels like civilization meets dungeons and dragons. Voiceover could still use a little improvement. For example when adjusting the slider for resources you can't get The exact number of resources you want to allocate.",
