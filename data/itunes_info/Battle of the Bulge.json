In this turn-based strategy game, you command your forces to capture important locations, secure key supply routes, and engage the enemy. Designed specifically for iOS, Battle of the Bulge captures the spirit of traditional board wargames while providing excellent UI design and accessibility for new players. \n\nKey features include: \n• Play against AI opponents with unique personalities\n• Play against friends online through Game Center or on one device with Pass and Play.\n• Fast turns, deep strategy\n• Play scenarios like the quick, tense, fight in the opening days to a campaign covering the entire battle as either the Axis or the Allies\n• Learn with the tutorial and quick start guide, or visit our online strategy forums to learn from other players\n• Full rules, charts, tables and other information included for advanced players\n• Extensive historical photos and commentary\n• Universal support for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch\n• Localized for Spanish and Japanese\n• Retina support\n• First in a series of WWII titles by legendary designers including: John Butterfield, Ted Raicer, and Mark Herman\n\n\nPraise for Battle of the Bulge:\n\n“It’s completely nailed the right ways to present a tabletop game in a digital format...” — No High Scores\n\n“Battle of the Bulge is a landmark iPad game. It’s deep without feeling complex, and fun without feeling light. Further, it’s beautiful, both visually and aurally, and so intuitive that you don’t need a tutorial to learn the interface. If you’re at all into turn-based gaming, give this one a try. If you’re not, give this one a try, anyway.” — MobileTechReview\n\n“A game that will make historical strategy diehards swoon, while also being pretty enough, and easy enough to learn, to draw in people who never knew that this was the game they'd been waiting for.” — TouchArcade\n\n“In terms of war simulation games on the App Store, I haven’t seen a better game…” — TUAW\n\n“…a game of considerable majesty awaits you…” — Gamezebo\n\n“Easily the most educational game I’ve ever played.” — Eurogamer\n\n\"Battle of the Bulge is as cold, brutal, and unforgiving as the titular conflict, but it's also one of the top choices for hardcore iPad strategists.\" - Pocket Gamer UK",

These crazy truckers are trying to run you off the road.  Semi-trucks, military trucks, 18-wheelers, and flatbeds are fighting for a chance to push this bus into a ditch.\n \nCollect fuel tanks and gold coins to unlock more bus driver teammates.  Collect NOS tanks for a burst of speed!\n \nBeep Beeeeep! \n\n---------------- \nHere's how the game works: \n\n- Gameplay is simple and becomes more challenging as you avoid oncoming truckers\n\n- Tilt to move your bus from lane to lane \n \n- Tap the screen for a boost\n\n- Collect gold coins and fuel tanks to unlock more buses\n \n- Collect NOS tanks for burst of speed and make you invincible\n\n- The longer you play, the faster the game moves. Each time you Turbo School Bus Warrior Battle it changes so you never play the same game twice \n\n- Gamecenter Leaderboards let you see how you score compared to other players by how long you're able to survive and collect gold coins\n\n- Challenge your friends to beat your score! \n\n-DISCLAIMER FOR KIDS MODE IN APP PURCHASE FEATURE- Kids mode is an In App Purchase feature within the game that allows the user to have unlimited health. Also this feature disables the ability for the character to collect in game coins and the ability to shoot down obstacles within the game. The purpose of this feature is to allow the user and/or kids for that matter to be able to play the game for an extended period of time without being hit by any in game obstacle. The user will also have the option to turn KIDS MODE OFF as well. \n----------------",
