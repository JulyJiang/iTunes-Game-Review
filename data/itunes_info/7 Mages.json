The earth, water and air there are still imbued with magic, which lures magic prospectors. These prospectors conduct savage raids at regular intervals on one of the unnamed villages on the island, robbing the hard-working peasants of most of their harvest. And so, one day, the peasants put together the last of their coin and hire the mages to protect them.\n\nThe epic RPG 7 Mages in the tradition of the greatest classics of the genre takes you around the magical island of Roven. You will visit gloomy crypts beneath the city, cross an icy mountain pass, submerge beneath the surface of the ocean and venture into the guts of a dead dragon. And lots more too! The game offers unique and very tactical turn-based combat with the option to split up your team, use combat magic, elemental magic and all-new musical magic.\n\n  * A fantasy game reworking of the legendary movies Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven\n  * 14 fantastic environments\n  * More than 30 types of enemy, most of them bringing new elements into combat\n  * Highly tactical turn-based combat with the option to split up your team\n  * 60 combat, elemental and musical spells\n  * Original puzzles on each new level\n\n- - -\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: A minimum of 1GB of RAM is needed to launch the game (iPhone 5 or higher, iPad third generation or higher)",
