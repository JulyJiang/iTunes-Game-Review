We given the performance a little tuneup and corrected an icon issue on iPad2 that a particularly diligent fan notified us about. One should never rest on one's ears, no matter how long they are.\n\nVersion 1.2\n\nRoll up Roll Up: Update NOW for essential improvements! \n\nStunt Bunnies Circus is back in town with an all NEW build for all the Stunt Bunnies fans out there! \n\nWe listened carefully to any problems the crowd had with getting into the performance and restructured the game to be a lot lighter on your device's memory. This means that older devices should have a much smoother performance, and more enjoyable gameplay, which is no more than any reasonable player should expect. \n\nOh, hey wait, theres more! \n\nWe've also included out 50 FREE COINS to help you get started in Claude's Circus Store and try out some of the cool kit to help Jet Bunny on his way. A few people asked for a little help on their first shopping trip. \n\nAnd last, but no means least,... we fixed lots of various little bugs of course, all part of the caring service from us to you.",

Chain together saves to score more points and land safely to earn your coins. The stunts will become more and more complex, involving cannons, tight ropes, flaming torches, lions and a variety of funny bunnies with different behaviours. There’s a small set of unlockable power ups that can make Jet Bunny's job easier: Crash mats, Fire jackets, Rocket fuel and the magical 'bullet-time' green carrot!\n\nCan Jet Bunny save his friends, please the crowd and still avoid the Fox's pot? Twitch your tail in the face of danger and find out.\n\n- 2 game modes, Arcade and Story mode, including 40 levels\n- Amazing graphics with animated cut scenes and a great storyline\n- Many different character bunnies with different performances\n- Unlockable powerups\n- Upgrade store\n- Leaderboards and Achievements through Game Center\n- HD and SD versions",
