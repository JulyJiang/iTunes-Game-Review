            "description": "Wayward Souls is an action-adventure game built for quick playthroughs and massive amounts of replay value. It was inspired by Spelunky, Secret of Mana, and our previous game, Mage Gauntlet.\n\nProcedurally generated random levels mean that every time you play the game, it's a different experience. Control one of six characters, all with their own unique playstyles, abilities, and equipment. Explore and fight for survival, in combat where your tactics, positioning, and timing matter.\n\nMore Features:\n- Fancy control scheme with no virtual buttons or sticks to fumble over.\n- Unlock new areas, for increasingly punishing difficulty.\n- 13 area types, all with different monsters, potential traps, and rare encounters.\n- Each character can find equipment combinations that change their gameplay.\n- Victory is based on your increasing skill as a player, not solely on grinding.\n- Hats.\n- No IAP ever, even for the hats. All content updates will be free for our fans.\n- Unprecedented scope and variety for an action-adventure game on iOS, maybe anywhere.\n\n@rocketcatgames or www.facebook.com/rocketcatgames",

            "description": "Five Card Quest is a tactical role playing game designed to offer lots of challenge and replay value, while also being easy to control with one thumb. There are five cards in your hand, and every card you play is a different move for your team of heroes to carry out.\n\nDungeons and battles are randomly generated, making every game different. Create a party of adventurers out of 5 different character classes, each with their own strengths. Plan out your moves in a game about decisive turn-based combat and working out strategies around uncertainty.\n\nIf you're very careful and a little lucky, you may be able to defeat the Golden King. You might even get rich in the process.\n\nMore Features:\n- Turn based battles let you agonize about each move and/or play it on the subway.\n- Difficult to win, easy to play.\n- Card game inspired battle system. You must plan based on what you have in your hand.\n- Fast paced combat, especially for the genre. Both you and enemies do lots of damage.\n- 16 different enemy types, all with different movesets and behaviors.\n\nThis is our first game in the turn based RPG genre. We'd like to make more!\n\nHelp us out, let us know what you think about Five Card Quest and contact us at:\n@rocketcatgames or www.facebook.com/rocketcatgames",
