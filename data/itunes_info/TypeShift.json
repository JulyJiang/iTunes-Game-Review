Play continues until you have used all letters in a puzzle at least once.\n\nSpecial Clue Puzzles combine Crosswords with Anagrams as you match clever clues provided by Typeshift's various puzzle authors.\n\n- Daily Word Game Play with Global Leaderboards - \n\nTypeshift features a free daily challenge with global leaderboards. The easiest challenge for the week appears on Monday, and progressively more challenging puzzles build throughout the week.\n\nCompare your fastest Typeshift daily solving times with players around the globe!\n\n------WHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\n\"Addictive and edifying, like popping a special kind of bubble wrap that expands your vocabulary.”\n- The Verge\n\n\"Typeshift is a unmissable entry to the [word] genre.\" Gold Award.\n- Pocket Gamer\n\n\"Typeshift is f*cking awesome\"\n- Giant Bombcast\n\n\"The Word Puzzle Game You've Been Waiting For\"\n- Waypoint\n\n\"Well worth your time\"\n- Sixcolors\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\n\nTypeshift comes with over a hundred free puzzles, with more coming soon, plus new free daily puzzles every day.\nAdditional puzzle packs may be purchased in-app.\nPurchasing any puzzle pack removes ads, and unlocks themes & detailed statistics.\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nTypeshift continues my quest to re-imagine classic newspaper games in the digital era. \nWhere SpellTower tackled word search and Really Bad Chess handled chess puzzles, Typeshift re-examines Anagrams and Crosswords.\n\nTypeshift has been a joy to develop, and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it.\nAs always, thanks so much for your support!\n\n-zach",
