            "description": "GL Golf Lite is a 3D sports game for the casual gamer. With a realistic physics system and great simple graphics, you and up to four players can golf all 720 holes for countless hours. Everything in a real game of golf is included, such as water hazards, sand traps, trees, bushes, wind, four seasons, different time of days to play, and a driving range. Other great features include both an internet and individual high score list, game saving, great music, iTunes controls, 3 difficulty modes, mulligans, the ability to choose your set of clubs, match/stroke play, online tournaments, customizable male and female golfers, and much more. GL Golf is constantly being updated with free new features. Four new courses are released every year, available for in-app purchase.\n\n*New Game Center Multiplayer Support* - Play against your friends or a random opponent on any of your favorite courses. Golfers alternate every three hole until a winner is crowed after all 18 holes are finished.\n\nIf you like GL Golf, make sure to check out Nuclear Nova’s other games, all available for the Mac/iPhone/iPad/iPod. \n• Nova Golf, the successor to GL Golf, is a much more detailed golf simulator with more modern graphics \n• Pinball Shuffle and Pinball Massacre are two unique comic book arcade style pinball tables \n• Barnyard Blaster is a unique shooter with plenty of weapons, animals, and environments \n• Rocket Golf gives golf a new twist with its unique 2D side scrolling gameplay \n• Liquid Defense, Hydrothermal, and Escape are our three classic puzzle/simulator games \n• Fractal 3D and ASCII Art are our first non-game apps\n\nPlay now on your iPhone, iPod, and iPad!\n\n\"This is a solid game and should definitely be on every duffer's app download list.\" -tuaw.com\n\n\"In the end, GL Golf is an incredibly deep game, serving up six courses and tons of options, it never gets old\" -iPhoneGamingNetwork.com\n\n\"Of all the golf games and simulations I’ve played so far for the iPhone, there’s one that stands head-and-shoulders above the rest. GL Golf.\" -intomobile.com\n\n\"I must say, this app is a very fun app. I am kind of addicted.\" -iPhoneMatters.com\n\n\"The game play is solid. To swing the club just double tap on the screen; when the power meter reaches to a spot you want, just single tap and the club will swing, hitting the ball. You can change the type of club you have by dragging your finger up/down the screen, thereby changing the range. The game does pause itself when you tap the home button, so if you get a call while playing, you won't lose your game. \" -Tuaw.com",
