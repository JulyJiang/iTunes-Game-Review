We are a group of veterans of the gaming industry, having worked on projects like Mafia, Vietcong, Mad Max or Witcher III in the past. With each of us having dedicated 15+ years of our professional careers to game development, we thought it was about time we started making games under our own flag. We love horror and sci-fi movies, good action, and cheesy one-liners. Our goal is to create entertaining games which combine fast-paced action with gore, humor, and lots of fun.",
