            "description": "From the makers of Plants vs. Zombies 2 and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 comes the next epic battle between doom and bloom – Plants vs. Zombies Heroes. Build your team of heroes in this courageous collectible card game. Embark on a journey to discover new characters and confront mighty opponents along the way. And, for the first time ever on mobile, play as either plants or zombies. It’s the lawn of a new battle!\n\nCOLLECT YOUR HEROES Discover 20 unique plant and zombie heroes, unlock their lawn-inspiring super powers, and choose your favorites based on their signature styles and abilities. Will you pick plants and deploy the masked, sharp-shooting avenger Green Shadow? Or will you choose a zombie hero, like the superbly superficial Super Brainz? Each hero’s unique selection of super powers helps define your team’s winning strategy.\n\nGROW YOUR TEAM Every hero needs a crew. Build yours and diversify your skills by collecting or crafting hundreds of cards – from the PvZ characters you know and love, to daring original plants and zombies. Devise distinct strategies when you select cards compatible with your hero, and experiment with devastating combos. Use the Deck Builder to quickly construct winning decks, try out strategies, and upgrade your decks as you collect and craft characters.\n\nBATTLE FRIENDS AND FOES Test your deck when you take on other players or challenge your friends in exciting real-time matches. Practice tactics in casual multiplayer battles or enter competitive ranked play to compete with the best players in the world. Earn rewards for defeating the bite-iest adversaries, and build your bank when you complete Quests from Crazy Dave and Dr. Zomboss.\n\nGO ON COURAGEOUS ADVENTURES Journey through the universe of PvZ Heroes as each action-packed skirmish takes you further along an ever-blooming map. Take on brain-thirsty or botanical foes along the way and hone your skills – each side has a different path to follow. Defeat challenging bosses to unlock fresh characters and new rewards. Even take your team with you when you switch between mobile devices – just sign into Facebook or Game Center to save your collection.\n\nImportant Consumer Information: Requires acceptance of EA’s Privacy & Cookie Policy and User Agreement.
