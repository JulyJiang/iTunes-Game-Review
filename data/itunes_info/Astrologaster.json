            "description": "Astrologaster is a story-driven comedy game set in Shakespeare’s London.\n\nLondon, 1592. A great plague sweeps through the capital. When doctors flee the city in fear, a hero rises. His name is Simon Forman, “Doctor” of Astrology and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can find their lost pets or even predict their futures, by reading the movements of the stars!\n\nBut when the plague ends, Forman’s problems begin. The real doctors return to London and they will stop at nothing to expose Forman as a fraud and bring him down. But Doctor Forman is determined to prove them wrong!\n\nAstrologaster is based on a true - and truly ridiculous - story.\n\n\nRead The Stars - Guide Forman in casting and interpreting real astrological charts.\n\nSolve Hilarious Problems -  Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies! \n\nChange Lives - Win your patients’ favor or ruin their lives. Advise 14 characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which often overlap with each other.\n\nWin A Medical License -  Convince patients to write letters of recommendations. Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical license. \n\nFully Voiced Character Dialogue - Sitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast of over a dozen actors. \n\nSing Along - Enjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character’s theme song. \n\nCasebooks Come Alive - Simon Forman’s cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up book. Turn pages to delve deeper into your patients’ stories.",
