Then, he receives a weird text: “Clear this mission...or face erasure.” With that, Neku is thrust into a life-or-death Game that sends him scrambling down streets paved with one riddle after another...\n\nWhat is the Reaper’s Game? Why is Neku a Player, and what is he playing for? Will the Game really end if he survives all 7 days? Another mystery is always around the corner.\n\n\nTHE PAYOFF\n-------------------------------------------------\n - Intuitive, addictive combat with a twist\nActivate your combat abilities, or “psychs,” with simple touch commands like tapping, slashing, and dragging. Comfy with that? Control Neku and his Game partner on the same screen and take the combat up a notch. Like loot? Boost your item drops in battle with the revamped Fusion system.\n\n -  Deep replay value\nFinish the main story to unlock a hilarious bonus chapter, more quests and items to find, new combat challenges, and secret reports that flesh out the story even more.\n\n -  Explore a living, breathing city\nNeku’s sprawling world is based on the real-life Shibuya in Tokyo. Visit real locations and absorb some real Japanese culture through a hip fantasy lens.\n\n -  Redrawn art and Retina display support\nEnjoy the game in full HD on your Retina-enabled iPhone 4 or later device. Art and animation across the game has been redrawn just for this release, making combat a beautiful experience. This is how all 2D classics should look.\n\n -  The ultimate soundtrack: 60 songs\nComposer Takeharu Ishimoto’s complete, sonically sublime soundtrack is included right in the game with high-quality audio and full vocals, including remixes and new songs.\n\n\n\nTHE VERDICT\n-------------------------------------------------\nPraise for the original The World Ends with You:\n\n“Compelling and immaculately presented...from start to finish” – Gamespot\n\n“Nails just about everything it tries – and it tries quite a lot” – IGN AU\n\n“Full of mysteries and surprises, interesting characters” – The New York Times\n\n“A compelling risk/reward system that...amply blesses the daring” – 1UP\n\n“Ice-cool artwork...impossibly catchy soundtrack” – Eurogamer\n\n“Games rarely have things this interesting to say” – G4TV\n\nDS Best RPG/Best Story/Best New IP and DS Game of the Year – IGN",
