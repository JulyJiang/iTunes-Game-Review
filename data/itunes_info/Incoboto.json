Collect star pieces to illuminate planets and open gates to other worlds where more puzzles and answers await. Each planet contains clues to the mysterious past of this dark universe. As you continue on your journey, you'll earn new abilities and find strange gadgets to aid in your quest.\n\nThe puzzles come in many forms. Master gravity, pop into portals, activate machinery, throw objects to trigger switches, and more. Think outside of the box and you may be able to get your hands on all of the secret star maps that are placed in the most out-of-the-way locations. Can you solve the many mysteries that lay between you and the answers you seek?\n\n- Solve Tricky Puzzles: Activate dormant machines to manipulate gravity, zip through portals, power moving platforms, and more!\n\n- Explore the Universe: Visit world after world, exploring the desolate remains to find hints and clues about what happened to the once-thriving civilization. \n\n- Get New Abilities: Learn to grapple, throw items, scan the planets for secrets, and gain other useful techniques that will help you track down every last star piece!\n\n- Collect Star Maps: For the ultimate challenge, try to gather all 50 of these out-of-the-way items. You'll need sharp wits and good reflexes to get them all!\n\n- Choose Your Controls: Pick between multiple control options to find the ones that suit you best!\n**************************************************\n\nGameClub is a subscription mobile gaming service.
