Pushing the boundaries of mobile gaming, Shadow of Death is an offline fighting game which doesn’t need the internet to be experienced. Fight the way you want as players can select among four unique shadow knights, multiple gameplay styles, and loads of rare armor sets to conquer a hostile dark world. Whip out that dark sword, collect some comrades, and slash the shadows!\n\nChoice to the Players \nChoose from a cast of four unique shadow knights each representing a vastly different play style. Whether players want to slash or force projectile their way to victory is in their hands, quite literally! Delve into a robust skill tree and deep inventory system that encourages endless combat experimentation and customization. We even have a young boy's soul in a hulking suit of armor, what other game can top that?\n     \nConquer the Darkness in Style \nInspired by classic fighting games and modern action RPGs, combat is a high-octane blend of magic and weapons based hack and slash gameplay. An intuitive touch screen interface provides different options to strategize combat and devastate enemies. The unique battle system is accessible for any player yet deep enough to satisfy the most hardcore action RPG fans. What are you waiting for?

An ancient darkness reborn savages the land with brute force. Crops decay, winds scream with rage, and the dead stir.   \nIn his lust for power and forbidden knowledge, a king has forsaken his people to ruin. The people cry for hope.  \nA lone knight, cleansed of memory but driven by conviction is all that stands between utter annihilation. Marked by destiny, he walks alone towards the whispering shadows. \n\nTake your game further and level up with us!
