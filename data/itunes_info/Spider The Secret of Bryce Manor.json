Make your way from the gardens into the mysterious abandoned home, building webs to catch your prey. Crawl up the walls and climb into crevices to find hidden surprises, and eat your fill of insects to grow strong. With intuitive touch controls, you'll be constructing massive webs with the flick of a finger.\n\nAs you make your way from room to room, your little spider will stumble across the pieces of the story of what happened to the former residents of Bryce Manor. Explore every room thoroughly to find every clue and solve the mystery the house holds within its walls. Be careful, though. There are other hunters around, and some of them have no problem making a quick lunch of you. You'll have to construct bigger and stronger webs to deal with some of the deadlier twists the game throws at you. With your human brain and spider skills, can you uncover the secret of Bryce Manor?\n\nUncover the Secret: Search every room thoroughly for clues about what happened in the abandoned manor. Observe your surroundings and solve puzzles to reveal the story!\n\nBattle Nature: Not everything you catch in your web will lay down without a fight. Construct larger and stronger webs to ensnare bigger and deadlier prey!\n\nInteresting Environments: Explore every inch of the house, from the garden to the attic and everything in between. Thread your webs across a kitchen, a dining room, and many more locations!\n\nIntuitive Controls: Use touch controls to take full advantage of your arachnid agility and zip around rooms with ease. Assemble amazing webs with a few flicks your finger, or soar through the air in any direction you choose. Doing whatever a spider can has never been simpler!\n**************************************************\n\nGameClub is a subscription mobile gaming service.
