            "description": "So you've mastered placing falling blocks? You can match colors like a pro? The reigning champion of your neighborhood at word games? Have we got a blend for you! Puzzlejuice is a combination of challenges that will put your skills to the ultimate test. Match up the colored blocks that fall from the top of the screen to generate letters. Take those letters and spell the best words you can to clear blocks before you get buried under the next pieces!\n\nIt takes a sharp mind and quick reflexes to stay ahead, but if you find yourself in a pinch you can make use of a variety of useful power-ups to level the playing field. Blast away nearby tiles with the Kabomb, mix things up with the Twister, deploy the Wildcard to get the letter you need to spell your word of choice, and more. There are 7 power-ups in total to unlock and deploy. Challenge the Core Mode and see how long you can last before the blocks overtake you, or tackle Zen Mode and see how high of a score you can rack up in 90 seconds. It's going to take all of your brain juice to rise to the challenge of Puzzlejuice!\n\nArrange the Pieces: Blocks of all shapes and sizes fall into the field. Piece them together as best as you can!\n\nMatch the Colors: Line up at least three blocks of the same color and give them a tap to change them into a mix of letters. The bigger the match, the more letters you'll have to work with!\n\nMake Some Words: Take those letters you worked so hard to create and spell some words with them! Which words? It's up to you, but if you want the best score you should think big!\n\nUnlock Power-Ups: Unlock and make use of 7 different power-ups to help you out when you're in a pinch. Explode unwanted pieces, smash away excess lines, freeze the incoming blocks, and more!\n\nMultiple Modes: Play the Core Mode to see how high a score you can rack up before the falling pieces take you out. Want to play without the pressure of the falling blocks? Try Zen Mode, where the pieces will wait patiently for your move. The catch? You've only got 90 seconds to maximize your score!\n**************************************************\n\nGameClub is a subscription mobile gaming service.
