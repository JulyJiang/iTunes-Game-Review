Search maps for new ' temporal hubs' that allow your characters to store their items between maps and playthroughs (later, once they are released, other modules). The temporal hubs also allow you to swap your current character for another (costing some experience). \n\nWe have also made revisions and edits to a wide variety of in-game items and components and have been working to clean up the game script.
