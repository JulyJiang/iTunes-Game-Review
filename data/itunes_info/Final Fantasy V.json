            "description": "Final Fantasy III -- now on iPhone!\n\nWhen darkness falls and the land is robbed of light, four youths are chosen by the crystals to embark upon a journey to save the world.\n\nFINAL FANTASY III was the first title in the FINAL FANTASY series to become a million-seller, establishing once and for all that Square Enix's classic RPG saga was here to stay.\n\nA hallmark of innovation for the entire series, FINAL FANTASY III incorporates not only a job system that lets characters change classes at any time to the ability to summon powerful creatures such as Shiva and Bahamut.\n\nThe 3D remake of FINAL FANTASY III, with fully-rendered 3D graphics, duplicated the original's success.\n\n- The four protagonists have been completely redesigned and new scenarios have been added.\n\n- The 3D remake has really brought the cutscenes and battles to life.\n\n- The Job system has been improved to bring out its best and most unique aspects, resulting in a more balanced game that is easy to enjoy.\n\n- New save functions, including autosave, allow for players to quit the game at any time without fear of losing their progress.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAditionally, the smartphone version has been improved to include the following:\n\n- High resolution graphics and retouched cutscenes.\n\n- Smooth, intuitive touch-panel controls specifically tailored to improve the gaming experience.\n\n- Gallery Mode, where players can view  illustrations from the game  or listen to the soundtrack, has been added.\n\n- New visual designs for the Job Mastery Cards and the Mognet .",
