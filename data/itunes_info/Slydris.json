            "description": "The #1 iOS Game of 2012 according to GameTrailers.com!\n\n\"Without doubt the finest puzzle game we've ever played on our mobiles.\" - Modojo.com (5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"This is a puzzle game that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the very best of the genre\" - EuroGamer.net\n\n\"Perfect touch controls never let you down. Manages to find a unique twist on line-formation gameplay.\" - Gamezebo.com (4.5 out of 5)\n\nSlydris is a unique and engaging puzzle game with a simple premise but deceptively deep gameplay:\n\n* Slide and drop blocks to create full lines of blocks.  \n* Create combos of falling blocks and clearing lines to fill up your bomb meter faster.  \n* Create a row of a single color for a color burster.  \n* Other special blocks (Shatter, Upcoming, Locked, and Magnet) add gameplay variety and challenge.\n\nThe three modes are Infinite Mode, Zen Mode, and Survival Mode:\n\n* In Infinite Mode, a new set of blocks drops after every move you make, so take as much time as you want.  Clear 25 lines to move onto the next level.\n\n* Zen Mode functions similarly to Infinite Mode, but the difficulty is more dynamic, there are no achievements or scores to worry about, and your game will never end (in Infinite Mode, the game ends if the stack reaches the top row).\n\n* In Survival Mode, you have 10 seconds to make as many moves as you can to clear the lines of blocks, then a barrage of blocks will drop, and the cycle begins again.  Quick thinking and nimble fingers are required to do well.\n\nSlydris is a highly polished and customizable puzzle game for all ages.  Select from 3 music tracks and dark or light backgrounds.\n\nSlydris supports Game Center Achievements and Leaderboards, iPad Retina Display, and iCloud saving.",

(Stuff.tv)\n\n\"Slydris 2 takes the core components of Tetris and plays around with them to brilliant effect\" 4.5 out of 5 stars! (Pocketgamer.co.uk)\n\n\"Slydris 2 is exactly the kind of game I’ve been waiting for and I’d recommend it to any puzzle fans\" (AppUnwrapper.com)\n\nIn 2012, Slydris took the mobile-gaming world by storm, launching to amazing critical and consumer reviews.  It went on to win multiple awards, including GameTrailer.com's 2012 iOS Game of the Year award, and ranking as Modojo's #2 iOS Game of the Year, and is Radiangames' most-played game of all time.\n\nSlydris 2 takes the basic gameplay concept of Slydris--sliding blocks left and right and letting them drop into place to create full rows--and refines it into the ultimate line-clearing endless puzzle game designed specifically for a touch screen.  Slydris 2's design brings more strategy and variety, and better balance to the Slydris formula.  \n\nThe relentlessly addictive gameplay is enhanced further with fantastic visual effects and earth-shaking sounds.  Slydris 2 also features 5 beautiful color schemes to unlock, and 5 mesmerizing music tracks that synchronize with the play field visuals.",
