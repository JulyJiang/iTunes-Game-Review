            "description": "Explore perilous dungeons, battle hordes of monsters, avoid devilish traps, and rescue the Sword of Fargoal in this award-winning dungeon-crawler RPG. \n\n• 85 / 100 - Metacritic\n• One of the “Best Video Games of All Time” - Computer Gaming World\n• 5 / 5 - TouchArcade “Best iPhone Games of the Year”\n• 9 / 10 - GamePro\n\nEmbark on an old school roguelike adventure packed with nostalgia, use a cunning array of magic spells and potions to help you when swords and brute force fail, and discover Sword of Fargoal, the genre-defining dungeon crawler game that inspired generations. \n\nThe Sword of Fargoal is somewhere in the depths of the dungeon, waiting for you to find it and bring it back to the surface. It's no easy task. Not only do you need to find your way around each maze-like floor to discover the stairs down to the next level, but you also need to survive any traps and monsters you stumble across on your travels. Each time you play, the dungeon and its contents change. \n\nYou'll find plenty of help along the way- tools, equipment, and magic spells. You never quite know what you'll find in the dungeon, but if you make the most of what you discover, you may well survive long enough to put your hands on the legendary blade itself. Of course, escaping with the sword is another task entirely.\n\n- Endless Questing: With a different dungeon to tackle every time you play, you'll never run out of adventures!\n- Become a Hero: Battle monsters, gather gold, and make offerings at temples to increase your power!\n- Awesome Treasure: Find a variety of spells, magical amulets, and mysterious orbs to help you on your journey!\n- Terrifying Monsters: Keep your wits about you to avoid defeat at the claws of grisly Gargoyles, powerful Shadow Dragons, invincible Demons, and many more. Even your fellow humans can't be trusted!\n- Multiple Difficulty Settings: Enjoy unlimited lives in Squire Mode, take on the standard Hero Mode, or try to tackle the ultimate challenge in Legend Mode!\n\n***Supports MFi, XBox, and PlayStation Controllers***\n**************************************************\n\nGameClub is a subscription mobile gaming service.
