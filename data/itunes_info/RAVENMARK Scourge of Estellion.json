RAVENMARK is striving to be a spiritual successor to that venerable franchise, and there are sublime moments where it comes pretty damn close.\" - Gizmodo UK\n\n\"The art is lovely, the strategy surprisingly deep and well-rounded.\" - Kotaku\n\n\"Witching Hour's maiden project Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion is almost everything this iPhone-touting strategy game aficionado could ask for... A complete and utter joy.\" - TouchArcade, 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\"A classy debut that hits all the right notes and puts other turn-based strategies in the shade.\" - Tap!
